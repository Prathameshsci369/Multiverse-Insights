Pretty much look like Modern day Sub Saharan Africa, except with more monarchies (because no colonization) and maybe some communist revolutions in some states.\n\nIf the Marathas win the Anglo Maratha wars and somehow survive without any sort of break offs, following the weakening, then we may see a united India (though smaller) and the NE and parts of South would be independent. I think there's a communist revolution in this country in the 1900s, and we may see a Communist India.",

        "selftext": "\nIn 1741, the cavalry of Raghoji Bhosle, the Maratha ruler of Nagpur, started to pillage western Bengal under the command of Bhaskar Pandit. Bengalis called these Marathas “Bargis” which is a corruption of the Marathi word, \"bargir\" (etymology: Persian) which means “light cavalry”. Malik Ambar, the celebrated Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, had instituted the Deccan practice of guerrilla warfare, which at that time took the name bargir-giri. These swift hit-and-run guerrilla tactics became a part of the military heritage of the Deccan, being used to great effect by Shivaji and, eventually, by the Marathas against the hapless residents of Bengal.\n\nBargir-giri\n\nIn the 1740s, the bargir-giri of Bhosle’s army confounded the forces of Nawab Alivardi Khan, the ruler of Bengal. While the Bengali army tried its best and even defeated the Marathas in the few times they fought head-to-head, most of the time, the Maratha cavalry would simply skirt the Khan’s slow-moving infantry, being interested only in looting.\n\nIn the 10 years that they plundered Bengal, their effect was devastating, causing great human hardship as well as economic privation. Contemporary Dutch sources believed that the Bargis killed 4 lakh Bengalis and a great many merchants in western Bengal, writes historian PJ Marshal, \"were permanently crippled by losses and extractions\".\n\nIn the Maharashtra Purana, a poem in Bengali written by Gangaram, the poet describes the destruction caused by the raiders in great detail:\nThis time none escaped,\nBrahmanas, and Vaisnavas, Sannyasis, and householders,\nall had the same fate, and cows were massacred along with men.\n\nSo great was the terror of the Bargi that, in a Gabbar-esque twist, lullabies were composed in which mothers would use the fear of a Maratha raid to get their children to go to sleep. These poems are popular amongst Bengalis even today. One of them went something like this:\nChhele ghumalo, paada judaalo bargi elo deshe \nBulbulite dhaan kheyechhe, khaajnaa debo kishe?\nDhaan phurolo, paan phurolo, khaajnaar opay ki?\nAar kotaa din shobur koro, roshoon boonechhi \n\nA very inelegant translation:\n\nWhen the children fall asleep, silence sets in, the Bargis come to our country\nBirds have eaten the grain, how shall I pay the tax (to the Bargi)?\nAll our food and drink is over, how shall I pay the tax?\nWait for a few days, I have sown garlic.\n\nThe ditchers of Calcutta\n\nNot only did the Bargis loot the countryside, but in a sign of their effectiveness, managed to raid the capital of Bengal, Murshidabad and even sack the house of one of the richest Indians at the time, the Marwari banker, Jagat Seth.\n\nIn spite of this, the Marathas never did attack Calcutta, in all probability being paid off by the British. The ditch, though, did serve to provide citizens with a nickname: ditchers, i.e everyone who lived south of the ditch, in \"proper\" Calcutta. Eventually the ditch was filled up and was made into what is now Upper Circular Road.\n\nAfter a decade of pillage, the Marathas eventually stopped their raids after the harried Nawab, accepting defeat, handed over Orissa to Raghoji Bhosle.\n\nPast through the lens of the present\n\nOf course, as Aakar Patel points out in his column, this history of the Marathas is usually never given popular currency. The Marathas are often portrayed as a proto-national force, acting as agents of either India or Hindu nationalism. This is a common tendency and modern nations often construct myths where they extend themselves back into time. Many Pakistanis imagine that its Islamic nationalism existed during the time of Qutb-ud-din Aibak and many Indians think that a Hindu nationalism was furthered by the Marathas looking to set up a – to use Vinayak Savarkar's term – \"Hindu Pad Padshahi\".\n\nIronically, the very phrase \"Hindu Pad Padshahi\" is taken entirely from the Persian language, showing how seamless the transition was from the so-called Muslim Deccan sultanates and the Mughals to the so-called Hindu Marathas. And, of course, such a simplistic view of history must also leave out pillaging bands of Marathas attacking a predominantly \"Hindu\" West Bengal even as a \"Muslim\" Nawab struggles to push them out. Today's India is so caught up with the binaries of \"Hindu\" and \"Muslim\" that it tends to see the past in those terms as well. But the past is a different country.",

From what I can find online it's true that the elites enlisted the Marathas' help to overthrow Alivardi, but the part where OP claims that Alivardi had his troops commit atrocities while wearing Maratha attires is probably not true (if it is true, I could not find sources anywhere). The wiki page for Alivardi doesn't have a lot of details or sources either so it's hard to say if he did indeed cause economic damage across Bengal; the wiki page states that after the treaty he \"turned his attention on rebuilding and restoring Bengal\".\n\nEDIT: Instead of down voting I'd appreciate it if you could engage in a discussion instead. I have no horse in this race; let's just educate each other and get as close to the truth as possible!",

                        "comment": "# Refuting Gangaram’s Account of the Maratha Invasion of Bengal  \n\nGangaram’s narrative of the Maratha invasion is deeply flawed, presenting a one-sided and selective interpretation that ignores historical realities. His portrayal of the Marathas as opportunistic plunderers disregards their legitimate intervention and strategic objectives. Below is a direct refutation of his claims.  \n\n## 1. Marathas Did Not Invade Without Just Cause  \nGangaram falsely suggests that the Marathas attacked Bengal without provocation. In reality, their intervention was both **invited and justified**:  \n\n- **Legitimate Invitation** – *Riyaz-us-Salatin* confirms that locals supported **Nawab Sarfaraz Khan’s faction**, which called for Maratha intervention against **the usurper Alivardi Khan**. This was consistent with Maratha policy—whether in Punjab, Gujarat, or Malwa, they acted at the behest of rightful rulers.  \n\n- **Retaliation for Alivardi’s Treachery** – Alivardi Khan **massacred a Maratha envoy and troops in Orissa**, a direct provocation. Diplomatic assassinations demanded swift retribution. The Marathas did not act recklessly; they upheld justice where treachery prevailed.  \n\n## 2. Bengal’s Wealth Was Not the Primary Motivation  \nGangaram reduces the invasion to mere plunder, ignoring **its strategic and geopolitical significance**:  \n\n- **Bengal was the gateway to the east**, a crucial region for Maratha dominance.  \n- **Weakening Mughal influence** in Bengal aligned with their larger imperial strategy.  \n- **Chauth was not loot**—it was an established tax system, unlike the arbitrary violence of Alivardi’s forces in Orissa.  \n\nEvery empire sought revenue, including the Mughals and Bengal Nawabs. Gangaram’s selective outrage over Maratha taxation ignores that Alivardi himself **looted Orissa mercilessly**.  \n\n## 3. The Marathas Were Not Religious Fanatics  \nGangaram falsely frames the Marathas as religiously exclusive. The historical record proves otherwise:  \n\n- **Both Hindu and Muslim landlords paid chauth and cooperated with the Marathas.**  \n- **Alivardi Khan himself sought Maratha support before betraying them.**  \n- **The Marathas did not impose religious laws**—unlike the Mughals, who enforced *jizya* and temple desecrations.  \n\nIf the Marathas were religiously exclusive, why did Muslim rulers like the **Nizam of Hyderabad and Nawab of Arcot** ally with them?  \n\n## 4. Alivardi Khan Was Not a Legitimate Ruler  \nGangaram assumes Alivardi Khan was the rightful Nawab, ignoring his history of **usurpation and betrayal**:  \n\n- **Alivardi Khan seized Bengal through treachery**, murdering Nawab Sarfaraz Khan in 1740.  \n- **His rule was unpopular**—he relied on brutal suppression, not public support.  \n- **Despite years of effort, he failed to crush Maratha influence**, showing that Bengal’s local elites were not fully loyal to him.  \n\n## 5. Marathas Had Every Right to Stay in Bengal  \nGangaram naively assumes that the Marathas should have left Bengal after victory. This ignores historical precedent:  \n\n- **Wherever the Marathas were invited, they stayed**—Malwa, Gujarat, Bundelkhand, Punjab.  \n- **Abandoning Bengal would mean wasting resources** on a temporary intervention.  \n- **Marathas imposed suzerainty, not annexation**, ensuring local governance continued under their oversight.  \n\n## Conclusion: Gangaram’s Account is Baseless  \nGangaram’s argument is built on selective outrage and half-truths. The Marathas did not invade Bengal as mere raiders—they responded to **local support, punished treachery, and secured their rightful influence**. If Gangaram wants to critique imperialism, he should start with Alivardi Khan—the usurper, the betrayer, and the true oppressor of Bengal.",

If the Maratha invasion was justified because Bengal had to abide by the Chauth imposed on the Mughals in Dehli, shouldn't Ali Vardi Khan also be considered the rightful ruler of the province since his usurpation was legitimized by the emperor in Dehli? \n\nAlso not sure why people act like rape and plunder was something this or that medieval army would never stoop to do, the vast majority of pre-sepoy Indian armies were comprised of mercenaries or light horsemen who joined campaigns for plunder. Individual leaders can be just and saintly but once they brought an army to another land it would have been virtually impossible for them to prevent plunder and other atrocities.",

Pre-colonial identities were regional, not subcontinental. \n\nFact:\nThe word ‘India’ comes from Greek/Roman terms for the Indus River (A river in Pakistan). Locals never used it politically until the British imposed it in 1858.\n\nNo empire not Mauryan, Gupta, or Mughal—ever ruled all modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The British Raj (1858) was the first to do so, the maps you see online most of them are made by jobless indians and not accurate at all. \n\nNo ‘Indian’ Identity Before Colonialism\n\nPeople identified as Bengalis, Marathas, Sikhs, or Rohillas *not Indians. The idea of a pan-subcontinental identity emerged in the 19th century imposed by British. \n\nJawaharlal Nehru’s words India was a collection of distinct cultures held together by geography \n\nThe British invented ‘India’ as a single colony (1858) by conquering 500+ independent kingdoms. Pre-colonial ‘unity’ is a modern myth and we often see the disinformation spread by hindus nationalists. \n\nIf India was a unified civilization, why did its ancient kingdoms like Mauryas, Guptas, Cholas never rule Sindh, Punjab, or Balochistan? Why did the Mughals, Marathas, and British all have to conquer these regions anew? Doesn't make sense right? \n\nThe Maratha (Hindu) and Durranis (Muslim) fought 27 major battles between 1758–1761 for control of Punjab and Delhi.\n\nIf *India was united, why did Hindu Marathas fight Muslim Nawabs, Sikhs fight Mughals, and Afghans raid Delhi? Why did these *Indian states never form a coalition against the British?\n\nEven the legal systems like Islamic Sharia in Muslim states, Hindu Dharma sastra in Maratha territorie, tribal jirgas in Pashtun/Baloch regions.  \n\nT british Conquest Proves There Was No Unity at all, there was no political india just a geographical term again a name after indus river from Pakistan geography. \n\nI mean why did no *indian army or identity resist them collectively? As yall claim it as political term. \n\nAlso Pakistan is not a new state. It is the culmination of a 1,000-year struggle of Muslims in the subcontinent to preserve their identity. \n\nIf Pakistan has no history, why did its regions consistently resist domination by Delhi-based empires (Mughals, Marathas, British)? Why did the Sikh rooted in Punjab fight the Marathas and Afghans, not align with akhand bharat or India?\n\nIf *Akhand Bharat existed, why did Ashoka’s empire exclude Tamil Nadu? Why did Shiva fight Mughals, not Tamil kings? Why did Sikhs, Pashtuns, and Bengalis never identify as akhand indian before the 19th century? Lol\n\nBecause it's historically illiterate. The subcontinent was always a collection of distinct nations, cultures, and religions. Pakistan’s existence is rooted in this diversity, not a colonial mistake.\n\nAkhand Bharat is a fairy tale for political gains nothing more than that. \n\nAnd the lazy united india tropes bring your historical facts, primary sources etc at least somthing there was no such thing as united india it was just a geographical term and tge world itself is after a river name in Pakistan. \n\n",

                "comment": "Everything you have written is historically accurate and I say that as an Indian!!\n\nThe reality is that after 800 years of muslim rule and 200 years of british colonial rule, Indians realized that the past political approach of hundreds of kingdoms, is not working out. We become extremely vulnerable to external invaders who come in, exploit our differences and end up subjugating all of us. Some foreign rulers have worked out well who took care of us afterwards like Akbar. Others like Aurangzeb gave us a hard time and someone like the British totally ruined us leaving with 90% poverty levels and devastation. So should we not learn any lessons from history?\n\nHence we wanted to create a state that is inclusive and works for everyone regardless of region, culture, religion, ethnicity, language with a common economy and common defence. We had to create a system that was fair and equitable, hence we implemented democracy, secularism and human rights. Now you can argue it is not perfect with all our issues, but its still better than being totally fragmented.\n\nMuslims decided not to be a part of this setup and demanded separation. We argued about it but then conceded it. There were just too many differences for us to be under one roof. But you are facing the same issues as we do in running a diverse country. \n\nOne thing we have to learn is to go beyond our rivarly and see the bigger picture. I often see Indians celebrating Pakistan's misfortunes and vice versa. Little do we realize that whoever harms Pakistan will most likely harm India too after reaching our borders. Same goes in the other direction. This is what has happened in the past and we must not let it happen again in the future. 🤔🤔",

But let’s be real—getting a subcontinent with hundreds of languages, cultures, races, ethnicities, tribes, and religions to vibe together under one strong federal setup? And actually making 1.42 billion people feel a sense of national identity? That’s next-level impressive.\nBack in the day, the Indian map was basically a chaotic puzzle of princely states, British provinces, and commissioner-run territories—565 of them, to be exact.None of them were forcibly merged into the Indian Union. Even though some rulers were reluctant, the people of those states, inspired by nationalism and the words of leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Bose, Sardar Patel, and Nehru, expressed their desire to join the Indian Union. This ultimately led to the formation of modern India.\n\nDespite such immense diversity and contradictions, the Indian federal structure has remained intact, which is truly astonishing",

So much so to the extent that Aurangzeb after getting the throne from his brothers, the result of a bloody succession battle in which, Rajputs like Maharaja Jaswant Singh stood by the side of Dara Shikhoh, the brother of Aurangzeb, Aurangzeb didn't even turn his head towards islamising Rajputana by the fear of the Rajputs, he was unfaithful of them and was sure that they would not allow his islamic policies to be induced in the Indian subcontinent. He was consumed in fighting the Rajputs, mainly the Houses of Mewar and Jodhpur for a long period of time ever since his ascension to the throne, while House of Jaipur gave internal support to the other two. Aurangzeb, getting angry at his Rajput Cheiftains turning against him, Posted Maharaja Sawai Jai Singhji to Deccan where he spent the last years of his life and sent Maharaja Jaswant Singhji to Afghanistan, where he breathed his last. The rebellions kept happening under the abled leadership of Maharana Raj Singhji and his sons as well as Veer Durgadas Rathore, the General of Maharaja Jaswant Singhji, this constant power struggle gave the Maratha Empire an opportunity to rise in power in the Deccan to later on cause problems to the Mughal Empire. Another glorious chapter in the history of Rajputana, while most of the current unionists focus on disassociating the Hindu Identity from Rajputs, it's high time we realise what our ancestors stood for, and what their Kshatriya Dharm meant. \n\n**Jai Rajputana** 🧡🌺, **Jai Shree Ram** 🧡.",

        "selftext": "I watched the trailer for \"Chhaava\" yesterday. Many people are excited about the movie. I am too, and I really hope they do justice to Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj's history. However, they seem to have missed an important point: the casting.\n\nVicky Kaushal is a hardworking and talented actor, but is he really the right choice for this role? Whenever anyone makes a movie about a historical figure—especially about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, or anyone from Maharashtra's history—they tend to cast actors who are much older than the actual ages of these figures.\n\nEntertainment industry often forgets that Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was just 23 years old when he was coronated, and he died at 31. He was very young and didn't have a mature appearance. The same goes for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who was only 16 (as were his Mavale) when he won the Battle of Torna Fort. No one has dared to cast a teenage boy in the role of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and depict him fighting against an adult army. It seems difficult for people to imagine a 16-year-old and his peers fighting and winning against a trained adult army, but that's what happened.\n\nEveryone reads in history books that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was 16 when he won his first battle, but few understand the scale of his courage and bravery. To speak in Marathi: एक कोवळा मुलगा हातात तलवार घेतो, त्या सोबत त्याचे १५-१६ वर्षाचे मित्र पण हातात तलवार घेतात आणि ही कोवळ्या मुलांची सेना युद्ध करते आणि जिंकते पण.\n\nDo you know how unbelievable that sounds? Yet, it is what happened, and it's difficult for many to imagine. One big reason is that no one has ever accurately depicted this on the big screen—the battles or the fighting style.\n\nI hope someone will eventually portray these events as realistically as possible. The casting of Timothée Chalamet as Henry V is a good example of accurate representation.\n\nNow, let's talk about one of the biggest drawbacks of these movies. I hope \"Chhaava\" addresses this properly: the brutality of Islamic rule and rulers over India at the time.\n\nThere is a scene from the movie \"Braveheart\" that always sickens me to the core: Droit du seigneur ( Please search on Youtube Prima Nocta- Braveheart ). While I'm not saying this was practiced by Islamic rulers, they went ahead and treated everything as theirs to loot and kill. Just once, I'd like to see a film accurately depict what Islamic rule actually looked like and let everyone in India know what Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Maratha Empire saved India from.\n\nRecently, I came across people from North India and Rajasthan disrespecting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj because they don't find him relevant or for some other absurd reason. For them to understand Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's fight, it's necessary for them to see and learn what he and the Maratha Empire fought against. Show them the real, vile, and devilish nature of Islamic rule.",

                "comment": "I thought the exact same thing. Sambhaji Maharaj was really young, but there's a counterpoint that older actors can play younger people. It really comes down to portrayal where I felt things were more amiss. Sambhaji Maharaj was not a \"hot-blooded\" wild warrior type of person, I think they're mixing Shivray's tone into his son's portrayal.\n\nSambhaji Maharaj was much more sheltered, had a far more privileged upbringing than Shivray. He is also recorded as being very tall for the 1600's. He did not have a huge beard like that of Shivray. Vicky Kaushal's height is no matter, but I don't feel he's bulked up for the role at all. The film somehow shows him looking identical to how they'd portray Shivray.\n\nThe aspects of historical accuracy haven't come up yet, so I don't want to comment on it. It doesn't matter what people outside MH think of the Maratha Empire or Shivray specifically; it's Marathi heritage first and always anyway and the Marathi Rulers didn't do what they did to please some idiots in 21st century.",

        "selftext": "While many know Ranchi as the hometown of MS Dhoni or the cool summer capital of Bihar during the British Raj, there’s a deep, often overlooked historical layer to this city. Here are some rarely spoken of facets:\n\n⸻\n\n🐘 1. Ranchi Was Once a Major Hub for Elephant Trade and Warfare\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the forests around Ranchi (especially in the Chotanagpur plateau) were famous for wild elephants. Local tribal groups, especially the Mundas and Oraons, had mastered the art of elephant taming, and these elephants were sold to Maratha, Mughal, and even Burmese armies. The British eventually regulated this trade and used elephants from this region during the First and Second Anglo-Burmese Wars.\n\n⸻\n\n📜 2. A Secret WWII British Camp Near McCluskieganj\n\nThere are credible but largely unpublicized accounts of a covert British wartime camp set up in the forests near McCluskieganj, about 65 km from Ranchi, during World War II. The base served as a signal relay point and emergency retreat for British officers from Calcutta in case of Japanese invasion. Locals still speak of “buried radio towers” and “abandoned bunkers” in the surrounding forests.\n\n⸻\n\n🏛️ 3. The Forgotten Anti-Conversion Laws of 1942\n\nLong before post-independence debates on religious conversion, the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act was briefly amended in 1942 during the British regime to restrict missionary activities in the Ranchi region. This was due to rising tribal discontent over forced conversions—making Ranchi one of the earliest regions where anti-conversion policies were legally attempted in colonial India.\n\n⸻\n\n🧬 4. Ranchi: An Early Center for Eugenics Research?\n\nThe Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum (now Central Institute of Psychiatry), established in 1918, was one of the first institutions in Asia where British doctors secretly conducted early eugenics research—studying heredity and mental illness among both Europeans and tribals. Some of these case studies are buried in old British psychiatric journals. This creepy chapter is almost entirely erased from public memory.\n\n⸻\n\n✊ 5. Birsa Munda’s Imprisonment Site Was Hidden for Decades\n\nWhile many know that Birsa Munda, the tribal freedom fighter, died mysteriously in Ranchi Jail in 1900, what most don’t know is that the original cell where he was held was kept inaccessible to the public until the early 2000s. For decades, local activists fought for its recognition and preservation. Today, it’s part of a memorial, but many believe key documents from his arrest and interrogation were destroyed or hidden by the British.\n\n⸻\n\n🏙️ Bonus: Ranchi Almost Became a Portuguese Trading Post\n\nIn the early 1600s, Portuguese Jesuits traveling through Bengal and Odisha explored setting up missions deeper inland. Ranchi, due to its plateau location and tribal diversity, was briefly considered as a midway “Christianizing outpost” between Goa and Bengal. Letters from the Jesuit archives in Lisbon mention a place matching Ranchi’s geography. The plan was abandoned after tribal resistance and malaria scares.",

        "selftext": "After hearing an entertaining [interview](https://timetoeatthedogs.com/2020/08/09/enemy-of-all-mankind/) on the podcast *Time to Eat the Dogs* with Steven Johnson, concerning his new book *Enemy of all Mankind*, I naively anticipated a light and narrative-focused book which would nonetheless offer some interesting and decently researched contextualization of the encounter between English pirate Henry Every and a Mughal treasure ship in 1695. I did not expect Johnson’s engagement with the Indian aspects of the story to involve deep primary source reading, but upon starting the book I found that, unfortunately, his engagements with Mughal and wider Indian history are not only shallow but deeply flawed, often in basic factual terms. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor one, he refers to the Mughal dynasty as “five-centur[ies]-old” (p. 113) at the time of Every’s piratical career, a rather baffling claim I can only ascribe to possible conflation with the Ghurids. Earlier he also conflates the Ghurids with the Delhi Sultanate, which he claims Muhammad Ghuri established (p. 36). The Delhi sultanate in fact emerged as a successor to the Ghurids following both the death of Muhammad Ghuri in 1206 and a protracted contest between his slave-commanders in different regions of India. The Mughal Empire was established by Babur, who conquered a stretch of North India in 1526; if one takes up the idealized Mughal claim to Timurid dynastic continuity, one could place the dynasty’s origins in the late fourteenth century, but as far as I know this is not an approach taken in any literature. As a discrete ruling dynasty, the Mughals emerged in the sixteenth century. Even the strained Timurid timeline is nowhere close to Johnson’s five hundred years. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe also appears to think of the word ‘Mughal’ as an imperial title interchangeable with ‘king’ or ‘emperor,’ as in this line: “declare yourself emperor/king/mughal” (p. 51). My thinking is that this arose from his use of European sources which refer to the Mughal emperors as ‘Grand (or Great) Mughals’, a formulation he repeats often; he also refers only to rulers as Mughals. Mughal is not at all an imperial title, but an ethnic or cultural identifier meaning ‘Mongol’ in Persian. On the theme of ethno-cultural confusions, Johnson refers to Mahmud of Ghazni as “Afghani” (p. 36). Firstly, Mahmud was of Turkic origin. Secondly, the conventional term for someone of Afghan origin is ‘Afghan’ rather than ‘Afghani’. Another odd moment worth mentioning is his description of the Mughal state as a “theocracy” (p. 8). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeyond these basic factual errors, there are some serious issues with his representation of the role of Islam in Indian history, especially his assertion that “some” (who exactly is not made clear) call it “the most devastating genocide in world history” (p. 36): his only attempt to back up this statement is a quotation from Fernand Braudel’s *A History of Civilizations* (1988) which asserts that Muslim dynasties could only rule India using “systemic terror”. Johnson breezily elides the earliest caliphate with the Ghaznavids and Ghurids as representatives of Islam in general (pp. 35-36) and seems to think that ‘India’ remained totally separate from ‘Islam’ throughout history: he states that commerce on the Indian Ocean became dominated by Muslims and not Indians well into the second millennium (p. 34), apparently unable to consider that those traders could have been both. He also parrots accounts of the reigns of Mahmud of Ghazni and Aurangzeb focusing on supposed Islamic iconoclastic zeal (pp. 36, 64-67), which are by now well criticized and qualified even in more accessible works like Richard Eaton’s *India in the Persianate Age* (2020). All these points deserve long write-ups, but I will focus on a rather more niche aspect of Johnson’s treatment of Indian history which aggravated me, since I have been reading up on it for research: the issue of specie and the economy. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJohnson rightly mentions that India took in a huge amount of precious metals in the early modern period, with some scholars estimating around twenty percent of the world’s output from 1600-1800. However he asserts that these precious metals’ economic value was nullified in India as they were melted down to make “bracelets, brocades and other ostentatious heirlooms.” (p. 50). This phrase is a direct quotation of John Keay, a popular historian and journalist whose book on the East India Company has, according to one review, “more in common with the chronicles of Harry Flashman than with the standard academic works on the East India Company” (Ó Gráda, p. 236). In Johnson’s formulation, Indian and specifically Mughal conceptions of wealth as a measure of precious ornaments would run up against the modern economic ideas of the East India Company, a joint-stock corporation: little did the opulent court of the sultans know that the latter would transform the politics and economics of the whole world. While there is something to the idea of the Company’s novelty in terms of structure and mercantilist economic ideology in the Indian context, to support it with the claim that India simply absorbed and sat on specie in the form of baubles flies in the face of years of research on early modern Indian economic history. The immense intake of precious metals created a large moneyed economy. States minted and were engaged in the exchange and regulation of a huge number of coins; large and sophisticated financial firms centered around families operated networks of credit, trade and investment as far afield as the Russian steppe; metal currency can even be seen in the religious rites of common people. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPerhaps crucial to Johnson’s apparent ignorance of the immensely important role of specie in the huge and active economy of early modern India is his focus on the Indian Ocean, and his all-too-easy use of one apparent Hindu prohibition of seafaring to conclude that Hindus simply did not trade and that India was totally passive in terms of trade and wider economic networks (pp. 34-35). This once again ties to his strange equation of all India with the same, immutable “Hindu culture” (p. 36). While older ‘traditional’ literature treats early modern overland trade as in terminal decline, overtaken by European-dominated overseas trade by the eighteenth century, a large body of literature has argued that overland trade systems, such as the horse trade or the trade in textiles to Central Asia and Iran, retained or even expanded their importance in the early modern period. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEspecially ironic given Johnson’s sharp dichotomy between pre-modern Indian/Mughal ideas of wealth and modern Company ones is that the rule of the Company in India was significantly bulwarked by the credit extended to it by Indian banking firms. Such financiers had invited Company rule in Surat in 1759 in response to their conflict with the local *nawab*. In the first war between the Company and the Marathas, it was these firms’ loans that allowed the supply of soldiers in the field. Decades later, Indian banks had a major stake in the invasion of Afghanistan (1839-42). Besieged in Kabul, British officer Eldred Pottinger attempted to secure cash by issuing multiple *hundis* (bills of exchange) worth over 1.3 million rupees to Indian treasuries to pay for a retreat to Peshawar. However the banks restricted payments into British treasuries, seeing the Kabul occupation as moribund: its failure threatened several banks with collapse. This in turn threatened the stability of colonial government at large. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe lack of up-to-date, accurate information on Indian history in Enemy of all Mankind is not all that surprising when one considers that, for a 250-odd page book, the bibliography is less than four and a quarter pages, or 69 entries, long. Many of Johnson’s claims are uncited, or at best supported by older books, often by non-specialists. As a result, every chapter focusing on India becomes a frustrating exercise in running into one error or misinterpretation after the other. Popular history can be entertaining and thought-provoking, but it must be held to a better standard.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSources:\n\n1.\tSteven Johnson, *Enemy of all Mankind: a True Story of Piracy, Power and History’s First Global Manhunt*.

                "comment": "It's written by this guy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Johnson_(author)? \n\nColor me unsurprised that he does bad history. \n\nI actually will go off on a little rant here, because this sounds an awful lot like a subset of badhistory that I particularly hate. I'm not really sure what I'd call it...maybe lazy Orientalism? Muslims and  \"Indians\" are different things, all Muslim rulers are basically the same (and run a genocidal theocracy), etc etc. Basically all these societies and their millions of people get reduced to an exotic backdrop for the Real Important Characters, who happen to be Westerners (usually English-speaking). \n\nThis is kind of a big issue I have with Peter Hopkirk's books on Central Asia (probably best known for *The Great Game*). All the \"natives\" or locals are basically indistinguishably just that, sometimes they are loyal, sometimes they are \"wild\", and all the Real Characters tend to be white Brits or their European adversaries. \n\nJohnson doesn't seem to be intentionally malicious, but he does seem to be a Very Educated Person (bachelors in semiotics and masters in literature) who usually writes Deep Thoughts on popular science and media, and so feels free to write sweepingly bad history because he vaguely remembers reading some stuff somewhere once. The Medieval history version of this of course would be *A World Lit Only By Fire* by William Manchester.",

This is just straight up 19th century British Oriental regurgitation. This exact argument was used to justify the use of Indian coolies in various British colonies when slavery was abolished. And apparently the South Indian trade and merchant houses werent real. And IF seafaring was an issue like he says what about the land trade with central Asia and Europe? That is a big reason Babur was attracted to India. By seeing the trade that flowed to and from the country when he captured Kabul.\n\nBy the way, i didnt realize John Keay had issues with his history. Could you maybe provide a short answer why?",

I'm open to someone who has read Keay contextualizing or qualifying that quotation, which may have been misused by Johnson (though it seems fairly clear to me).",

        "selftext": "You must be wondering why I am writing this post here. Many people attack Maharashtrians, falsely claiming that **Marathas invaded Bengal out of greed and hatred**.  \n\nThe truth is, **Marathas never attacked any region without a valid invitation or just cause**—Bengal was no exception. They entered to **enforce rightful Chauth, defend Hindu interests, and punish Ali Vardi Khan’s betrayal**.  \n\nI urge you to **read this carefully, understand the facts, and counter the misinformation**. It’s time to **defend our history with truth, not propaganda**.  \n\n# **The Truth About the Maratha Invasion of Bengal: A History Buried Under Lies**  \n\n## **TL;DR**  \n- The **Marathas did not invade Bengal for mindless loot**—they were **invited by Bengal’s own elites** to enforce **rightful taxation** and **end Nawabi oppression**.  \n- **Ali Vardi Khan, not the Marathas, was the real villain**—a **cowardly usurper** who massacred unarmed Maratha officers and betrayed Bengal’s future.  \n- The **Marathas never raped or violated women**—even European sources confirm this was **Nawabi propaganda**, while **Ali Vardi Khan’s troops disguised as Marathas to commit atrocities**.  \n- **The Marathas did not attack during religious festivals**—instead, Ali Vardi Khan exploited Maratha religious observances (Sandhyavandanam, Ashtami fast) to launch cowardly ambushes.  \n- **The Marathas were not defeated**—they forced Ali Vardi to **pay Chauth, cede Orissa, and accept humiliating penalties for his treachery**.  \n- **Had Bengal been under Maratha rule, the British might never have conquered it**. Instead, **Ali Vardi’s betrayals left Bengal weak, making Plassey in 1757 inevitable**.  \n- **Modern historians, particularly Jadunath Sarkar, have erased the truth to glorify Ali Vardi Khan and vilify the Marathas.**  \n\n---\n\n## **1. Bengal Before the Marathas: A Province in Chains**  \n\nFor centuries, history has been **deliberately rewritten** to glorify **Ali Vardi Khan**, painting him as the *savior of Bengal* while branding the **Marathas as ruthless invaders**. The reality?  \n\n**Ali Vardi Khan was not a just ruler—he was a usurper who seized power through deceit, bled Bengal dry through taxation, and provoked the Marathas into war.**  \n\n### **The Real Face of Ali Vardi Khan**  \n- **Ali Vardi Khan overthrew Bengal’s rightful Subedar, Mirza Baqar Ali Khan, in 1740**. His rule had no legitimacy—**it was based purely on brute force**.  \n- **His oppressive taxation ruined Bengal’s economy**—even British and French traders condemned his policies.  \n- His troops **sacked Orissa, desecrated temples in Puri, and persecuted Hindu landlords**, triggering a massive backlash.  \n\nThe Marathas **did not invade Bengal out of greed—they were compelled by circumstance**.  \n\n---\n\n## **2. The Justified Maratha Intervention: Three Key Reasons**  \n\n### **1. Enforcing Chauth (Rightful Tribute)**  \n- Bengal had long been evading **Chauth**, a tax already paid across Mughal territories to the Marathas.  \n- As de facto rulers of Hindustan, the Marathas **were enforcing a legitimate taxation system**.  \n\n### **2. Defending Hindu Interests and Allies**  \n- **Ali Vardi Khan’s invasion of Orissa provoked war**. His troops **looted temples in Puri and oppressed local Hindu zamindars**.  \n- The Marathas were **obligated to intervene**, not as invaders, but as **protectors of their allies**.  \n\n### **3. Marathas Were Invited by Bengal’s Own Elite**  \n- **The Raja of Bishnupur, Mirza Baqar Ali Khan, and other Hindu landlords** saw the Marathas as liberators from Ali Vardi’s economic oppression.  \n- Even Bengali sources confirm that **many zamindars allowed the Marathas to pass through their territories without resistance**.  \n\nThe **Marathas were not foreign invaders**—they were **restorers of order, rightful tax enforcers, and defenders of Hindu interests**.  \n\n---\n\n## **3. The Mankara Massacre: Ali Vardi Khan’s Ultimate Betrayal**  \n\nBy 1744, the **Marathas had forced Ali Vardi Khan into a defensive position**. Instead of fighting honorably, **he resorted to treachery**.  \n\n### **The Betrayal at Mankara**  \n- **Ali Vardi Khan invited 22 senior Maratha officers for peace talks**, pretending to negotiate.  \n- As soon as they arrived, **he had them executed in cold blood**.  \n- These were **unarmed men, expecting diplomacy—not a massacre.**  \n\nThis **single act of treachery** turned Bengal into a battleground for **retribution, not taxation**.  \n\n---\n\n## **4. The Wrath of Raghuji Bhonsle: Maratha Vengeance**  \n\nThe **Marathas had a strict rule of justice**—for every officer killed through treachery, **eleven of the enemy would pay the price**.  \n\n### **Raghuji Bhonsle’s Response to Mankara**  \nWhen news of the **Mankara Massacre** reached Nagpur, **Raghuji Bhonsle launched his full force upon Bengal**. This was no longer about taxation—it was **about restoring Maratha honor**.  \n\n- **Maratha forces razed Nawabi supply lines, crushed Ali Vardi’s armies, and systematically dismantled his fortifications.**  \n- In one of the **most brutal acts of justice**, **200 Nawabi soldiers were publicly executed in front of Ali Vardi Khan’s envoy as retribution.**  \n- By **1750, Ali Vardi Khan surrendered**, agreeing to:  \n  - **Pay an annual Chauth of 12 lakh rupees.**  \n  - **Cede Orissa to the Marathas.**  \n  - **Accept the “Mund-Katai” fine**, a humiliating war indemnity for his betrayal.  \n\n---\n\n## **References**  \n\n1. **Orme, Robert.** *A History of the Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan*. (1763) – **Details Nawabi taxation policies and Maratha military campaigns.**  \n2. **Seir-ul-Mutakherin (Persian Chronicle)** – **Describes the Mankara Massacre and Ali Vardi Khan’s treachery.**  \n3. **Holwell, J.Z.** *Interesting Historical Events Relative to the Provinces of Bengal and the Empire of Indostan*. (1765) – **Exposes how Ali Vardi’s troops disguised themselves as Marathas.**  \n4. **Riyaz-us-Salatin (Bengali Chronicle)** – **Confirms Ali Vardi Khan’s brutal taxation and suppression of zamindars.**  \n5. **Kumkum Chatterjee.** *Merchants, Politics and Society in Early Modern India* – **Analyzes Bengal’s economic collapse under Ali Vardi Khan.**  \n6. **Jadunath Sarkar.** *Fall of the Mughal Empire* – **Exposes his reliance on Nawabi sources, ignoring Maratha records.**  \n7. **Bharatchandra Ray’s Writings** – **The only Bengali writer who personally met the Marathas and did not vilify them.**  \n\n---\n\n## **Final Words**  \n\nThe **Marathas did not destroy Bengal**—**Ali Vardi Khan did**.  \n\nThe **Marathas did not invade for greed**—they came to **enforce rightful taxation, defend Hindu interests, and punish treachery**.  \n\nBengal was **not lost in 1742 when the Marathas entered**—it was **lost in 1744, when Ali Vardi Khan betrayed them**.  \n\nIt’s time to **reject Nawabi and British lies** and **reclaim our true history.**  ",
