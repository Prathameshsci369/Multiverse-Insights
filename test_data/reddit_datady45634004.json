When there is an incident like this, it is natural that politicians and far right hindu nationalists will try to milk this situation for their own gain and I can see that happening myself (I live in the state where this incident happened) but that doesn't mean that the incident itself is made up. I think the statement of the girl and her parents is a pretty good reason for this post to exist. Your skeptisism is always welcome and you can give this your own value but I think it's pretty clear that the girl really did die.\n\nHere is an [article](https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/in-tamil-nadu-schoolgirls-suicide-high-court-directs-holding-of-last-rites-2723409) to look at it from a different perspective. The police has not found any evidence for forced conversion but the hostel warden was arrested.",

Now it is not the same as before.  Now thillai Natarajar temple is maintained by independent body not the HR&CE. Go to chidambaram see it for yourself and then compare it with vaitheeswaran (temple pond which we Hindus believe could cure any ailments stinks and algae everywhere on steps. Extremely slippery not advisable for anybody to climb down) madurai Meenakshi amman kovil has illegal shops inside the temple premises itself. Who gave them permission to set up stalls. Any good work done to temples come from independent wealthy people like the karumuthu Kannan  family and PTR family for  Meenakshi temple. It is a common site to see dogs and dog shit inside age old temples like the vaitheeswaran kovil. \n\n\nHR&CE can enter only when there is a financial mismanagement in the temple and there are supposed to exit soon after setting and handing over their documents and responsibilities to new management. What they are doing is the exact opposite. HR&CE is behaving like they are the custodians of all the temples in TN. Until Hindus unite this will continue. People like you hate brahmins for no reason and your blinded by the hatred that u can see how HRCE is plundering OUR temples. Before you come at me I am not a brahmin.",

        "selftext": "So I've been dating a great person for the past 6 months and we get along incredibly well. She's kind, smart and empathetic but we hit a roadblock constantly when talking about religion.\n\nFor background I was raised Catholic, but I do have exposure to hinduism as my dad's family is mostly hindu although he is an atheist. When I turned 18 I stopped going to church with my mum although I still follow her on occasion when she insists. \n\nSo back to the small issue we have run into, when we get to talking about religion, and I tell her I'm not into religion but I'm okay if you are, she constantly refers to hinduism as something you are born into and to be respectful when talking about it as it's not a religion. So far I haven't actually said anything about it cause I'm afraid of offending her. \n\nHow do I explain to her my side and to counter her argument while being polite as the last thing I want to do is belittle her\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for your responses, I really appreciate all of them. I got some really good advice and some not so good ones but the community in this sub is always relatively polite. As for my gf and I, she's not devout, an extremist or a follower of the caste system and I guess her being offended by me challenging her beliefs were all in my head cause she was pretty open to it. We had a constructive conversation that reinforced my will to marry her ASAP. Yeah I know its a little early but when you know, you know right? \n\n Wish us luck and thanks again everyone! ",

There is no single holy book, no set of commandments, no claim of being the only true religion, no centralized church, no single god or diety, no concept of blasphemy, none of that. The only reason it gets classified as a religion is because that is how it fits in mental framework of people raised in Abrahamic faiths and also the legal framework requires it.\n\nThis is not to say that there isn’t plenty of stupidity in the range of Hindu beliefs, or that the Hindus who do believe in one or more gods are believing in anything other than a fairy tale, or that the average Hindu can’t be as much of a scumbag as a member of any other religion. But on the one point OP raised his gf happens to be correct. He may have left Christianity and become an atheist, but his brain is still stuck in the old framework.",

It is in fact her culture, regardless whether she believes in afterlife or the creation myth, asking her to abandon Hinduism is like asking to assimilate into a western lifestyle. \n\nImagine if someone said because you're atheist, you should abandon all the cultural trappings of your society's religion, so forget marriage, Christmas, having Sundays off, counting new year from January, may as well abandon the Latin alphabet and democracy since they spread through the world with Christian crusades and the Roman Empire. You get the drift. In Hinduism, that link is even stronger than what I just described.",

It really comes down to asking if she has belief in a supernatural entity or not. From there it's most likely semantics.\n\nI was very close to a family who were atheists in every sense of the word, yet they observed all the cultural customs of Hinduism as they were from India. It really is no different then me celebrating Christmas and Easter, just a little more often and a little more intense.",

A lot of people here will tell you they don’t believe in any gods, but they still go to the shrine and follow a lot of the Shinto practices that have bled into everyday life. Many religions in the east are syncretic. They can be combined with others or be more connected to culture than belief. Listen to what she’s telling you and realize your definition of religion is defined by your culture.",

        "selftext": "I (26 F) am aware that this is an incredibly controversial topic but I am at my wits end in this situation and my family and friends are overseas and mostly incapable of helping me due to inexperience and lack of awareness. I am in the UK for my PhD and my roommate (28F) is muslim. We usually get along very well and I have been respectful and accommodating of her religious practices. I am very aware of the rising islamophobia worldwide and try to advocate against it whenever I can. I feel the need to mention these things because they become relevant. I am an atheist myself. My roommate on numerous occasions has tried to discuss religion and theology with me, but I have quickly shut her down fearing that this may lead to a conflict due to our differences. After her several attempts of comparing our respective religious backgrounds, I firmly told her that religion is that one topic I don’t want to remotely touch in a conversation with her because I did not want an argumentative and tense relationship with someone I share a roof with and she understood and stopped. Everything was fine for months until she started following those drives on tiktok where people get a hijab makeover on the streets and look pretty and thought of doing such a drive of her own. I gave her a thumbs up and moved on until she said she wanted to practice on me. I told her that I am not comfortable with this. She told me it is just a piece of cloth and it won’t hurt to try because I may end up liking it. I firmly told her that while that is absolutely alright, I don’t want to try it on, because I am simply not interested. This went on back and forth for some time until she told me that she is glad my islamophobia is finally out in the open and I have exposed myself. I was shocked and I asked her what made her think that I am an Islamophobe based on this one incident when I have gone above and beyond for her comfort. I abide by all her dietary restrictions in our shared kitchen despite not having any such restriction of my own. Once I bought this beautiful statue of a Hindu Goddess (not for worshipping purposes but purely for aesthetic reasons) and she told me that she was uncomfortable with the violent figure. I immediately complied and packed it away without any argument. I profusely apologised to her and I told her that I have nothing against hijab just because I don’t want it on me. She stopped talking to me altogether after that. A couple of other people on the campus have reported that she is telling everyone how uncomfortable she is sharing a place with someone so hateful towards her religion. While I am hurt that I have lost a friend overnight, I am also extremely scared that the word may reach the university administration and they might take disciplinary action against me. I may lose my scholarship or maybe thrown out of college altogether. I am an international student and this would mean my career will be completely over. I don’t know what to do or how to explain my end of the story because no one seems interested. I have continuously and unconditionally apologised to her since the event but nothing seems to work. Could anyone tell me where did I exactly go wrong and how can I fix this situation? \n\nEdit: I believe I need to clarify that I am from India and I belong from an “untouchable” dalit caste. I don’t have any interest of pandering to racial and religious hegemonies because it will end up working against my interests and of the numerous brilliant dalit students who have academic aspirations. \n\nEdit 2: She wanted to me to be a model for hijab trials because she wants to make social media content like hijab transformation videos. I see that a lot of people here don’t know about them. Basically, hijabi influencers have this drive/ campaign of sorts where they ask random women on the streets if they would like a hijab makeover and put hijab and modest clothes on them. There is nothing coercive in this. You can check Baraa Bolat for such content and you will get the idea. I personally didn’t want to participate in this because of the “no-religious stuff between us” boundary that I had established with my roommate and I was concerned that this may once again lead to religious debates like she used to attempt in the past.

At uni 15 yrs ago, i was in a similar situation. I complained and got kicked out of halls for religious intolerance. My ‘crime’ was ignoring all the muslims on my floor and their insistence i try their religion but they all lied that i said iSLamapHObiC things.  \n\nMy then bf was Muslim for gods sake but even he was forced to leave me by their ‘community’ because why waste time with someone who wont convert?",

And the same goes for the aforementioned hijabi friends. In fact, I think any practicing hijabi with a modicum of sense should have a better awareness of how the hijab and modesty is policed in our own communities, and that there are plenty of negative connotations with forcing/coercing someone to put it on. \n\n  \nIf everything is the way you say it is, I hope your college has the sense to see there's nothing oppressive or Islamophobic about refusing to wear a piece of clothing you don't agree with yourself, even if you respect another person's choice to wear it. It's not the same as modeling for something else either; there's an ideological component to the hijab and you can be unaligned with it without being an Islamophobe. Kinda funny your roommate's so quick to spy Islamophobia anyway when she can't even adjust to a Hindu representation that no one's forcing her to pray to. She doesn't sound particularly tolerant of other worldviews honestly.",

The idea that someone is pressuring you to wear/try on a hijab is unacceptable.\n\nAgree with those who recommend that you request other accomodations or a roommate change. Roommates don’t get along all the time, and housing services should be able to help you. I would not put the actual issue in writing - it is a sensitive matter.\n\nFollow up on your request by learning who processes these requests, and then ask to speak with someone senior. It may be best to meet them in person if you can manage it. Explain to them that you are not getting along and that it may be time sensitive. If pressed for more information, then you could explain that there are other differences here, and that it is a sensitive matter, that it could upset the community, and that it is best for you to move. \n\nAlso, I would not tell my roommate that I am leaving until you get your personal items out. Find another accomodation and go. She has showed her true colors by seeking to destroy your reputation and she may seek further drama at the next opportunity. Unfortunately, it seems she is not your friend.",

It makes her uncomfortable,  hello  same thing back at her.   Tell everyone else having  a go at you  that they can wear it instead.  \n\nShe is absolutely allowed to wear what she wants, but  not to enforce it on you.  \n\nI also would stop catering to her decisions on the decor in your shared space.",
