        "selftext": "A lot of people here really need to understand one important thing, India was not over and over conquered by foreigners, in fact India remained throughout history arguably the most successful settled military power in Asia. The problem is that we seem to skip centuries and just learn Indian history from one defeat to another. For example; from Hunnic invasion of Toramana in 495 CE to the Arab conquest of Sindh in 716 CE, to Mahmud's invasion from 1010 to 1026 CE, to the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192 CE, to the Invasion of Timur in 1398 CE, to First Battle of Panipat 1526 CE, Seond Battle 1556 CE, and the Third Battle in 1761 CE, the Battles of Plassey and Buxar 1764, and finally the Colonial wrap up betwenn 1799 to the Sepoy Rebellion. As you can see, any student who learns our history in this manner, skipping decades and centuries to jump from one defeat to another, will only take away that India is land of pushovers. Something that our history syllabus seems to encourage a lot. I'll try here to give a different perspective, a more complete one of you will.\n\nIf we compare India with China, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and other great centres of civilzations, it probably is the only civilization that continued to be largely ruled by its own native elite for most of its history, unlike the others.\n\nI request people to start reading histories of other Asiatic civilizations and compare it to India. However, let me here give everyone an idea of why I would regard India as the most successful settled civilization.\n\n1. What people actually mean by repeated occupations of India basically mean the North Western frontier, Gandhara, Punjab and Sindh, but rarely beyond that. These regions were basically always either under a foreign power or an Indian empire.\n2. Now when it comes to the foreign invaders who actually were able to make lasting gains in India, that includes the Kushans and the Western Kshatrapas, the former's rule till Mathura last around a generation or 2, before Indians pushed them out. As for the latter, they ruled Western Indian States such as Gujarat and Malwa, and even parts of Maharashtra at their peak, and were probably the only successful foreign invader to actually localize completely.\n3. Persia has never been militarily superior to India, in fact the case has usually been vice versa. Persia usually dominated only Sindh or parts of Gandhara, nothing more. This was also shrugged away as soon as a powerful Indian empire would rise. Alexander and his Greeks were given more trouble by Porus, a relatively minor King, and scattered tribes and repulbics of the North West India than all of the 'mighty' Persian empire, not to mention Indians actually defeated the Greeks in 2 wars folllowing that. Against the Sassanians, once more Samudragupta is said to have defeated them, backed by his coins in the Gandhara region. Even when we compare the Sassanian and Gupta performance against Hunas, we see the Guptas showing far more competenece. Skandagupta could fight a 7 year civil war, and then march and defeat the Hunas from the North West, meanwhile the Persian Shahenshah Peroz waged three wars against the White Huns, losing all 3 miserably. Even when the Hunas did succeed in defeating the Guptas, this triumph last around 20 years, after which Toramana was defeated by Prakashadharman Aulikara in the Third War. The last war between the Indian Kings and Mihirakula was of course the end of the Hunnic occupation, with the Huns retreating back to Punjab and Gandhara. Eventually by the time of Prabhakaravardhana Pushyabhuti, Harsha's father, the Hunas no longer posed a great threat, and were but one of the enemies against which the Pushyabhutis waged war.\n4. India remains the sole Asiatic civilzation to have defeated the Arab caliphates at the very zenith of their power from the early to the late 8th century. The Arabs conquered Sindh in 716, and from 720s onwards made incursions into India, but these were always driven back once the Arab governors left. Eventually the Arabs under Al Hakam led a large army in 736 CE against Vallabhi, the declining capital of the Maitrakas, at this battle, Jayabhata, the Gurjara Chief of Nandipura (South Gujarat) reached Vallabhi, and defeated the Arabs in a great battle, proved by 736 CE inscription. Al Hakam returned with a larger force, overruning most of Gujarat, however, this time Pulakesin, the governor of South Gujarat for the Chalukya Empire, arrived to face the Arabs, and in 739 CE, at Navasari, he defeated the Al-Hakam. This gave regional Marwari and Gujarati chiefs to throw off the Arab yoke, and Nagabhata I Pratihara of Jalore emerged as a great leader, defeating another Arab invasion sometime before 756 CE. Nagabhata's grand nephew Vatsaraja Prathiara united most of Rajasthan and with his general Srivarmaka, defeated the Arabs, and even captured their commander. Finally, seeing that the overland route was no longer possible, the Arabs sent an expedition of around 10,000 men by sea to invaded Saurashtra in 776 CE against a relatively the small state of the Saindhavas (also called Jayadhrathas). This expedition also failed, and this was the final Arab offensive against India. After this, powerful Pratihara rulers such as Mihira Bhoja could easily march upto Multan and demand tribute from the Arabs. In fact Arab of Multan were so impressed by the power of the Pratihara Empire, that they themselves issued Adivaraha coins in imitation. Compare these successes against the Caliphates with defeats suffered by the Byzantine Empire, losing Egypt, Syria, Iraq and half of Anatolia to the Arabs, or Spain, coming under Arab and Berber rule for centuries, or the Persian Sassanid, which was wholly conquered. Even the Great Tang Dynasty lost Central Asia to the Arabs after their defeat at the Battle of Talas. When you compare these with Indian successes, then you realize just how impressive the Indian militaries were.\n5. There is also the question of India's influence on Afghanistan and the North West. Now for most part, Indian empires had little interest in pursuing an active policy in that quarter due to the regions not being rich enough to warrant expeditions. However, it must be noted that the Mauryans, Guptas and the Pratiharas, all either directly or indirectly reduced Gandhara region to submission. Chandragupta Maurya conquered it from Seleucus, Samudragupta and Chandragupta II reduced the region to vassalage with their expeditions, and the Pratiharas installed the Hindu Shahis in Gandhara, who, as per Hudud ull Alam, acknowledged the Pratihara Emperor at Kannauj as their overlord till the late 10th century. In all cases, it was only after the disintegration of the Mauryans, Guptas and the Pratiharas, that the Indo Greeks, Hunas or the Ghazvanids could succeed in invading North India, but even those were temporary incursions, succeeding in occupying only Western Punjab.\n6. Let us now look at India's Medieval period, the Ghazvanids invaded a scattered North India, however, even powerful regional kingdoms like the Chandellas gave them staunch resistance, and forts such as Gwalior and Kalinjar remained undefeated. The Ghazvanid raid on Gujarat took the Solankis by surprise, but the Ghazvanid triumph was short lived, as Bhoja Paramara of Malwa, the other great North Indian ruler post the Pratihara decline, attacked Mahmud, forcing the Ghazvanids to retreat via Sindh, losing many men in the process. Ghazvanid retreat was followed by Indian kings retraking Delhi, and even threatening Lahore. Chauhan consolidation in Rajasthan finally put an end to the Ghazvanid menace. Ajayaraja Chuahan built Ajmer as bulwark, and his son Arnoraja defeated a large Ghazvanid army near Ajmer, and his son, Vigraharaja drove the Ghazvanids from Eastern Punjab. The initial Ghurid invasion of Gujarat was also defeated at Kasharda, and later the first first Battle of Tarain. If you're noticing here, from first Arab invasion of India proper in 720s to Mahmud Ghazvanid's invasions in early 11th century, to finally the Ghurid conquest and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1192, it took almost 5 centuries for India to give ground. Compare that to Iran, Iraq, Central Asia, Syria, Egypt and Anatoila, in fact modern day Turkey that has completely switched its identity.\n7. During the Delhi Sultanate, the Turks ruled the Indo Gangetic, but failed to again conquer all of Rajasthan with the Chauhans of Ranthambore, Guhilas of Mewar and Vaghelas of Gujarat defeating them, in central India, Yajvapalas, Chandellas and Parmaras held them off, the latter retaking Bhilsa right after the death of Iltutmish. In Orissa, Narasimhadeva of Eastern Ganga dynasty infliced a great defeat on the Sultanate forces at the Battle of Katasin in 1244, once more driving the Turks away. So in 13th century, again the Turks could not become a pan Indian power. It was only with the Khiljis, who in fact had an army composed of mostly local troops, that the Delhi Sultanate became the predominant power of India. However, within 50 years, Telugu Nayakas, the Vijayangara Empire, Mewar and many other powers emerged out of rebellions. By late 14th century, the Sultanae hegemony was gone, and by the time of Timur in 1398, only a small area around Delhi remained. Between Timur's invasion and that of Babur, the two most powerful States in India as per Baburmana were Vijayangar in South, and Mewar in the North. Not including others such as Marwar, Gajapati Orissa, Bundelkhand, Garha etc. Thus, even Pre-Mughal India remained mostly under Indian dominion, unlike rest of Asia that had only changed masters from Arabs to then Turks, then Mongols, and then again Turks. Compare that to Indian native resistance, and again you see the warped perspective many have of apparent Indian 'weakness'.\n8. The Mughal Empire, for all far right blame game, was very much an Indian empire. Its chief partners were the Rajputs. There are claims made by some Indian historians that most of the Mughal nobility was Turkish or Persian. But here is the caveat, none of them were allowed to have inheritable or permanent jagirs, with a few exceptions, most of this foreign nobility only last for a generation, their family members rarely inherited any court or political influence. This in contrast to the Rajput and even local land owners. Rajputs were granted Watan Jagirs (hereditary fief), and also in addition the Tankhwa Jagirs (Assignment Jagir). This alone made the Rajputs the most important partners of the Mughals. Not just that, the Mughals also made permanent the holdings of petty zamindars who were incorporated under imperial government. The only blip is Aurangzeb, but it is pertinent to remember that he even opposed and discriminated against Muslims of other sects, and also tried to curtail the power of Shaikhzadas such as the Sayyids of Barha.  It is to be remembered that once the Mughals did try to interfere in Rajput successions and executed Sambhaji with uncommon brutality, they suffered immense political and military consquences, which led to the defeat of the Mughal power in both Rajasthan and the Deccan, the latter defeat proved far more costly as the Marathas then gobbled up half the empire between 1700-1738.\n9. In the 18th century, India remained probably the only Asiatic country under its native rulers, the Marathas, Sikhs, Rajputana, Mysore, and even those regional states with foreign origin rulers such as Awadh and Hyderabad, had largely native elite propping up the foreign origin rulers. Compare that to Qing China, ruled by the Manchus, both ruler and the elite, Iran, ruled again by the Turkoman tribes (Nader Shah was one, and his quotes show much disdain for native Iranians despite his own claim to being Shah of Iran), and of course Iraq, Syria, Egypt etc, that always seem to be under foreigners. Even Greece, Balkans and Eastern Europe was largely under the Ottomans, it had been so since almost 300 years. Even the East India Company Army was manned by Indian soldiers, and financed by Indian merchants and bankers. So this idea that India was some invader's paradise is largely a myth. The British colonization was the first in India of its kind, and that seems to have crippled much of our psyche. \n\nI hope this post helps people to understand India's history in the right context.",

                        "comment": "What do you mean by 'finishing the job'?\n\nIndians finished the job as well as any pre-colonial polity finished the job. The same can be said of the Arabs, that they did not finish the job, allowing local Gujaratis and Rajasthani chiefs to rule on under them, which bit the Arabs  back when one great defeat in Navasarika led to mass rebellions and the complete collapse of Arab rule in India within months.\n\nHere is another perspective, Vatsaraja I definitively destroyed the Arab offensive in India when his general, Srivarmaka, defeated and captured the Arab General, Vatsaraja's son, Nagabhata II installed the Hindushahis in Afghanistan as vassals and a buffer state to keep India safe for almost 200 years. Earlier Samudragupta attacked the Gandhara to curb Persian influence, and later Chandragupta II marched to defeat the Hunnic threat, and even exterminated the Sakas entirely from India. Closer to our time, was Mahadji Scindia any less decisive in his culling of all Rohila Afghan power in North India?\n\nFact is that Indians were no less decisive or ruthless when given an opportunity. Prithviraja could not catch Mohammad Ghori because the latter was with a common trooper, unconscious, and impossible to spot. Mohammad Ghori himself tried to make Prithviraja his vassal, sparing him initially, and then had to wage another war when Prithiviraja rebelled. So let us dispense with this myth as well, Indians were not innocent honour bound simpletons waiting for their doom. They acted when they could, and refrained when they could not, like everyone else.",

        "selftext": "**A genuine question to all Indians, especially Hindi speakers:**\n\nWhy is it that almost every non-Hindi speaking state has seen some form of anti-Hindi movement over the years?\n\nIt’s not just about language pride—it seems like there’s a repeated, widespread pattern across India where states have had to actively defend and promote their local languages institutionally and politically, often in response to perceived imposition from Hindi.\n\nJust look at the history:\n\n**Tamil Nadu** has led one of the strongest and most sustained anti-Hindi movements since the 1930s, with mass protests and deep-rooted political resistance.\n\n**Karnataka** has seen moderate resistance—mostly in response to Hindi signage and employment bias—with periodic protests, though not as intense.\n\n**Kerala** expresses cultural and political pushback, focused more on preserving Malayalam without major mass movements.\n\n**Andhra Pradesh**, **Telangana**, and many **Northeastern** states have had low-key or sporadic objections—usually around protecting linguistic diversity, though without sustained activism.\n\n\nNow coming to **Maharashtra**:\n\nWhile it doesn’t have the same scale of historic movements like Tamil Nadu, there has always been a consistent thread of protecting and promoting Marathi. The opposition to Hindi hasn’t been about hostility—it’s been about ensuring Marathi remains strong in public life, education, and governance.\n\nBut something about this recent controversy feels different.\n\nFor the first time, I’m noticing more and more Marathi speakers themselves expressing that they’re being personally and socially affected—not just linguistically. We’re seeing real consequences, like discrimination in housing markets and public spaces, where being a native Marathi speaker or Maharashtrian has become a barrier. That’s a big shift. Historically, most Maharashtrians have supported Marathi without needing to reject Hindi. But now, that balance feels like it’s tipping—not because of hate, but because people are feeling pushed out in their own state.\n\nAnd Maharashtra isn’t the first state where this has happened. It’s part of a broader pattern we’ve seen for decades.\n\nSo again, to Hindi speakers in particular:\n**Why do you think this pattern keeps repeating across states and generations?**\nIf these many regions have pushed back, maybe it’s time to reflect on what the root cause actually is.",

Central government was too smart to subsidies only for Hindi tuition in Southern states. Southern states opposed Hindi according to 3 language formulae.

Southern states will now have more burden of investing for a third language tuition. \n\nBest solution is: Learn your local language + English as a link language. Since English is a global linking language, it will help all.",

Nobody despises Hindi , we just don't want to place it above our values and regional language ,cause it has led to erasure of local cultures before , why is that so difficult to grasp I don't understand .People rarely get extreme with this IRL , they just would appreciate it more if you tried  leaning into their culture and native lang  atleast a bit .India isn't a single culture , this is the fact Hindi imposition peeps just won't understand. I hate it cause I love the linguistic diversity of India and do not wish for it to be done with to appease some entitled folks and their braindead take to replace our rich cultures all across the subcontinent. And tbh , it's better we place English as the official language and not hindi ,simply cause of how useful it shall be for Indians in education ,trade and many other industries .",

They will deny even vegetarian Maharashtrians because ultimately they want to replicate what they do in their states and bring back casteism wholly. \n\nFucking hell, Malabar Hill, once a land of Kolis, was \"gentrified\" by Lodha family and is now only for rich Jains. We are pushed outside Mumbai despite being the reason why Mumbai was more hospitable than any city in this country. We even adopted their Hindi and made it our own so we can help communicate.\n\nAnd what do we get in return? Casteist labels, denying housing under the guise of \"personal choice\", taken advantage of and denial of our own language.\n\nThere's a reason why only North Indians face \"language\" issues anywhere in this country, they downright lack the respect for the locals and think of them as someone to take advantage of. \n\nAlso fuck MNS for just being a hooligan party but you should also note they are being allowed to do this despite having 0 seats in state or centre. It is possible for us to condemn MNS for being criminals and wanting their arrests while at the same time want Maharashtrians and Marathis to actually be able to live in their own state, eat their own food, speak their own language without judgement.",

        "selftext": "\nSo for a long time there has been a hateful narrative that Marathis had no contribution to building Mumbai and it was built by some outsiders. This narrative is feuled majority by few communities who’ve always had insane hatred against Marathis. \n\nBut now let us get to the point that should have been addressed long ago- **MARATHIS HAVE THR MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION TO BUILDING MUMBAI & MAHARASHTRA** \n\n**1. THERE WOULD BE NO MUMBAI WITHOUT MARATHIS**\n\nBritish didn’t build only Mumbai, they also built Kolkata and Chennai and many other cities. In fact, for the longest time British had put all their focus on Kolkata and Chennai. Their focus was always Kolkata and Delhi.\n\nMumbai is not a city built from scratch. Marathi and Agri people have inhabited Mumbai since millennia with records going back to 3rd century BCE. So Marathis have lived in Mumbai for at least 2 millennia.\n\nMarathi’s first inscriptions date back 2200 years. Marathi is 1200 years older than Hindi, Gujarati and Marwari language.\n\n\n**2. MUMBAI BECAME THE FINANCIAL CAPITAL UNDER MARATHI GOVERNMENT IN 1970s**\n\nPeople should go and read history. Mumbai was not the financial capital neither the business or trading hub under the British. Till 1960s and 70s, Kolkata had much more trading volume, business opportunities and jobs than Mumbai. Kolkata was at least 50-70% bigger than Mumbai through 1900-70. Kolkata was the biggest city in India till 1980. \n\nIt’s only in 1980 that Mumbai overtook Kolkata to become the financial capital of India. British built Bombay was never the financial and trading capital of India, Mumbai (developed by Marathi government) became the financial capital of India. \n\n**3. MARATHIS BUILT NOT JUST MUMBAI BUT ALSO PUNE**\n\nTill 1950, Kanpur and Lucknow were as big as Pune. If today Pune is a tier 1 city, the credit goes to Maharashtrian government and political leaders for making policies and decisions to develop Pune and the rest of Maharashtra.\n\n**4. MAHARASHTRA WAS MADE PROSPEROUS BY MARATHI GOVERNMENT**\n\nAt the time of independence, Maharashtra was the third poorest state of India. The British and their loyalists traders and businessmen looted Maharashtra so much that MH had higher poverty than UP, MP, Gujarat, Rajasthan. It’s us  Marathi people who developed Maharashtra to become the most prosperous state. Till 2010s, MH was ahead of most major states in GDP per capita. So the credit for Maharashtra’s prosperity goes to Maharashtrian government formed of Marathi people. \n\n**5. MARATHIS GAVE THE CULTURE TO MUMBAI**\n\nMumbai is famous as the safest city for women in India when it’s as big as Delhi. It’s the liberal culture of Maharashtra and the tight vigilance provided by Marathi police that makes this city so aspirational for women. The freedom and liberalism of city is provided by the native culture.\n\n\n\nEveryone wants credit for Mumbai and Maharashtra and wants to belittle Marathi people should remember that your Bombay was not the richest city and financial capital of India, and Maharashtra was legit a poor state at independence. \n\nTamil Nadu is developed today,everyone gives credit to Tamil government. Andhra and Telangana government and political leaders get credit for Hyderabad. Modi and GJ government get credit for Gujarat. And so on…\n\n**It’s only and only in Mumbai and Maharashtra that the entire credit is given either to British or to some traders and businessmen. Maharashtra government and political leaders and the Marathi people that form the culture and workforce of this state never get credited for anything!!! Why? Why?** \n\nIf just traders and businessmen could build cities then Gujarat won’t be struggling to have a tier 1 city in 2024. Bengaluru was behind Ahmedabad in 1980 but raced ahead. Ahmedabad and Surat still can’t match to Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru. \n\nWe are systematically insulted and belittled with the narrative that “Marathis have no contribution to this”. We get discriminated and hated in this city despite having contributed so much to it and this is literally our land. We are expected to be welcoming but in return we only get hatred and only hatred by outsiders. We only got hatred, discrimination and insult. How is that fair? \n\nI understand that not many of us are good at business because we historically never had a trading caste, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t contribute to this city in other way. We formed the government that made decisions and policies, we gave doctors, engineers, teachers, workers, etc we contributed in every possible way yet we are insulted and told “Marathis didn’t built this city”….\n\nIt’s wake up call for all fellow Marathis. Please wake up, we have excelled in so many fields, now it’s very crucial for us to succeed in industry and business. Otherwise the future is dark for our kids, they will have to bear more insults than we did. Fellow Marathis should understand that in today’s world money is not just power, it is dignity and respect too. Please don’t ignore it anymore.  \n",

        "selftext": "\nIn 1741, the cavalry of Raghoji Bhosle, the Maratha ruler of Nagpur, started to pillage western Bengal under the command of Bhaskar Pandit. Bengalis called these Marathas “Bargis” which is a corruption of the Marathi word, \"bargir\" (etymology: Persian) which means “light cavalry”. Malik Ambar, the celebrated Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, had instituted the Deccan practice of guerrilla warfare, which at that time took the name bargir-giri. These swift hit-and-run guerrilla tactics became a part of the military heritage of the Deccan, being used to great effect by Shivaji and, eventually, by the Marathas against the hapless residents of Bengal.\n\nBargir-giri\n\nIn the 1740s, the bargir-giri of Bhosle’s army confounded the forces of Nawab Alivardi Khan, the ruler of Bengal. While the Bengali army tried its best and even defeated the Marathas in the few times they fought head-to-head, most of the time, the Maratha cavalry would simply skirt the Khan’s slow-moving infantry, being interested only in looting.\n\nIn the 10 years that they plundered Bengal, their effect was devastating, causing great human hardship as well as economic privation. Contemporary Dutch sources believed that the Bargis killed 4 lakh Bengalis and a great many merchants in western Bengal, writes historian PJ Marshal, \"were permanently crippled by losses and extractions\".\n\nIn the Maharashtra Purana, a poem in Bengali written by Gangaram, the poet describes the destruction caused by the raiders in great detail:\nThis time none escaped,\nBrahmanas, and Vaisnavas, Sannyasis, and householders,\nall had the same fate, and cows were massacred along with men.\n\nSo great was the terror of the Bargi that, in a Gabbar-esque twist, lullabies were composed in which mothers would use the fear of a Maratha raid to get their children to go to sleep. These poems are popular amongst Bengalis even today. One of them went something like this:\nChhele ghumalo, paada judaalo bargi elo deshe \nBulbulite dhaan kheyechhe, khaajnaa debo kishe?\nDhaan phurolo, paan phurolo, khaajnaar opay ki?\nAar kotaa din shobur koro, roshoon boonechhi \n\nA very inelegant translation:\n\nWhen the children fall asleep, silence sets in, the Bargis come to our country\nBirds have eaten the grain, how shall I pay the tax (to the Bargi)?\nAll our food and drink is over, how shall I pay the tax?\nWait for a few days, I have sown garlic.\n\nThe ditchers of Calcutta\n\nNot only did the Bargis loot the countryside, but in a sign of their effectiveness, managed to raid the capital of Bengal, Murshidabad and even sack the house of one of the richest Indians at the time, the Marwari banker, Jagat Seth.\n\nIn spite of this, the Marathas never did attack Calcutta, in all probability being paid off by the British. The ditch, though, did serve to provide citizens with a nickname: ditchers, i.e everyone who lived south of the ditch, in \"proper\" Calcutta. Eventually the ditch was filled up and was made into what is now Upper Circular Road.\n\nAfter a decade of pillage, the Marathas eventually stopped their raids after the harried Nawab, accepting defeat, handed over Orissa to Raghoji Bhosle.\n\nPast through the lens of the present\n\nOf course, as Aakar Patel points out in his column, this history of the Marathas is usually never given popular currency. The Marathas are often portrayed as a proto-national force, acting as agents of either India or Hindu nationalism. This is a common tendency and modern nations often construct myths where they extend themselves back into time. Many Pakistanis imagine that its Islamic nationalism existed during the time of Qutb-ud-din Aibak and many Indians think that a Hindu nationalism was furthered by the Marathas looking to set up a – to use Vinayak Savarkar's term – \"Hindu Pad Padshahi\".\n\nIronically, the very phrase \"Hindu Pad Padshahi\" is taken entirely from the Persian language, showing how seamless the transition was from the so-called Muslim Deccan sultanates and the Mughals to the so-called Hindu Marathas. And, of course, such a simplistic view of history must also leave out pillaging bands of Marathas attacking a predominantly \"Hindu\" West Bengal even as a \"Muslim\" Nawab struggles to push them out. Today's India is so caught up with the binaries of \"Hindu\" and \"Muslim\" that it tends to see the past in those terms as well. But the past is a different country.",

        "selftext": "It’s an irony that many people can’t figure out why, despite being a powerful community with profound representation of the business and political classes in the state, the Marathas are opting to be labeled as backward. However, a deeper study reveals a wide disparity within the community, forcing the larger percentage of Marathas to live below the poverty line while a small percentage of the creamy layer rule the roost. Seeing the distress of the Maratha people, most of whom were farm laborers, the eminent Congress leader Annasaheb Patil started the historic Maratha reservation movement, going against the line of his party, the Congress-led state government. However, his agitation was based on economic criteria and not on the caste. Post his demise, the characteristics of the Maratha reservation movement were changed to caste-based agitation, making things more complicated and drifting away from the goal of Annasaheb Patil to achieve economic upliftment for the impoverished Maratha people.\n\nAnother irony is that since the time the [Maratha reservation](https://devgatha.in/en/maratha-reservation/) movement started in the early eighties, Maharashtra has seen most of its CMs from the Maratha community, but no headway either for the caste identity or economic development of the poor Marathas. Maharashtra reeled under devastating droughts every year, worsening the situation of Maratha farmers and forcing them to fall victim to loan sharks. Statistics say nearly 90% of the farmers who committed suicide to save their families from agri-loans were from Maratha communities.  \n\nThe change was initiated in 2014, slowly but decisively, with Devendra Fadnavis becoming the new chief minister, known for his unbiased, pro-people, and courageous stands, brimming with visions and energy. He decided to take a two-pronged strategy to address the causes of the Marathas. Firstly, he undertook many standout projects based on water conservation methods to eradicate drought. All his projects involved government-people's joint participation, providing income for villagers to maintain the rural economy against the backdrop of severe income loss due to drought. And secondly, he waged a series of efforts for Maratha reservation, announcing his government’s resolution for 16% reservation for Maratha communities. On one hand, his efforts raised the groundwater level to help with irrigation for sustainable agriculture, beating the drought; on the other hand, his government moved the Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court order that turned down the 16% reservation quota proposed for the Maratha communities. On one side, he created education and job opportunities for the Maratha youth to help them stand on their feet; on the other side, his government formed the state backward class commission to make a concrete study of the socio-economic standing of the Maratha communities to establish their right for reservation in the Apex Court. Fadnavis has always believed and practiced inclusive development, which has led to noticeable improvement in governance delivery to all citizens of the state, irrespective of caste, creed, and religion. This, together with his transparency and zero corruption record, has built an air of trust and confidence around him that people started believing that under Devendra Fadnavis, the state will prosper beyond the need for quotas.    \n\n",

Debates rage around his political ideology, but in the noise, we lose sight of the man’s deeper contributions.\n\nHe was a rationalist who dared to question deep-rooted traditions. He openly spoke against superstition, meaningless rituals, and even questioned the taboo around beef. He openly wrote that eating beef should not be a moral issue, stating that “a nation that worships the cow but lets fellow humans starve is morally bankrupt\". That kind of thinking, especially in his time, took real courage.\n\nHe fought against the caste system. In Ratnagiri, he opened the Patit Pavan Mandir to Dalits something almost unthinkable back then. He didn’t just talk about equality; he practiced it, inviting people of all castes to eat together, live together, and stand together.\n\nAnd then there’s what he did for Marathi—his poetry, his plays, his powerful writing gave voice to an entire generation. His language was bold, emotional, and rooted in Maharashtra’s soil. He created over 45 new Marathi words to replace foreign terms, making Marathi more expressive and proudly self-contained. Words like “दूरदर्शन” (television), “महापौर” (nayor), and “अर्थसंकल्प” (budget) are just a few examples of the linguistic legacy he left behind.\n\nEvery Marathi should bow their head to this towering son of Maharashtra. Today, let’s remember him not through the lens of politics, but through the impact of his life’s work.",

They romanticize Mughal invaders, glorify British stooges, and kneel before Marx, but foam at the mouth when a Hindu revolutionary dared to speak of civilizational pride. They call him a coward while sitting in air-conditioned studios, knowing nothing of the Kalapani where Savarkar was chained like a beast for ten years. They whine about “mercy petitions” but hide the fact that Nehru, Gandhi, and others also wrote appeals, difference is, Savarkar came back to inspire a national awakening, not play elite politics. They label his Hindutva “hate” because it threatens their ecosystem of vote-bank appeasement, cultural guilt, and Hindu self-loathing. They can't stand that he spoke with spine when their idols bent with shame. The truth is simple: they hate Savarkar not because he was wrong, but because he was right. unapologetically, relentlessly, and far ahead of his time.",

        "selftext": "Let's keep aside for now the necessity and requirement of reservation for the Maratha community. The movement which did not have a face until last year has gotten one and he is leading in all aspects of this morcha.\n\n\n\nWithin a year, Manoj Jarange Patil has managed to become face of the Maratha Hindu community, where bigger names in active politics could only managed to do so much. Jarange Patil definitely has full support of rural area and a considerable chunk of urban population.\n\n\n\nLet's assume: Maratha community gets a reservation. What happens after that? Jarange Patil packs up his stuff and returns to Antarwali Sarathi, where he lives happily ever after?\n\n\n\nNo. The support he has with him, of the majority (%) has to be directed somewhere. He will. Shiv Sena, with Balasaheb Thackrey, did put up a sounding fight, the legacy of which is fought on by his children, biological and ideological. BJP on the other hand has a general goodwill of the Hindu community all around the country. No one can deny that. But in Maharashtra, they don't have a face. Of course the PM will do rallies and speeches.\n\n\n\n\nBut now there is a bigger force that moves support, and is identified in Manoj Jarange Patil. He holds power that is desired by all aggressive political parties. Move millions with a speech, gather support up and down the state. But currently he is not affiliated to any party (or is he?).\n\n\n\nOnce the decision for guaranteed reservation has been passed by Maharashtra govt., behind the scene moves will be played (might have already started before all this) to bring Jarange Patil to their fold. Assuredly it will be one of the saffron parties, Shiv Sena, BJP or the Shiv Sena (UBT).\n\n\n\nNot let's revise to our assumption: Maratha community does not gets reservation on terms Jarange Patil has put down.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\nHe surely has got the support to make or break a government. He ought to direct this overwhelming support somewhere. Political parties ought to cash in on this support, which he has gathered for them. People will simply close their eyes and cast their vote on the button Jarange Patil takes the flag of. With state and central elections around the corner, he can be the keymaker in Maharashtra.",

        "selftext": "From personal experience after taking with multiple people, relatives and colleague here's the list that i think compounded in BJPs loss: \n1. Marathi pride: allowing gujjus to control everything in Mumbai, letting businesses which were coming to mh go to gujrat and given higher social priority in major businesses (BEST pamphlets in gujrati language in Mumbai) and the residential area segregation finally making social media rounds.\n2. Religion politics is incompatible with Marathi identity. Being Marathi comes first. If a UP Hindu says anything to Marathi Muslim because he's Marathi, guess who's going back to UP in stretchers..\n3. Breaking regional parties by ED blackmail as if the people are blind to see what's happening\n4. Ajit \"corruption\" Pawar - Do I even have to explain? \n5. Edited\n6. People are more educated nowadays about who to vote and don't vote. That's why center might have modi and people of Maharashtra might also want modi as PM but on local level, we don't give a fuck about BJP and modi as much as we care about the actual candidate. There's a reason bjp lost in every constituency where modi gave speech in Maharashtra. Majority of BJP candidates didn't do anything in last 5 years assuming modi wave will carry them again.\n7. BJP was always a supporting party to shivsena, never was the main party, never will be. They made mistake of assuming they are the lead. The local parties were always the ones marathi people trusted for their goodwill and seeing BJP break them apart using money and blackmail was sure to get the voters who were on fence like myself against BJP.\n8. People resonated with Rahul Gandhi and his efforts despite being extremely outnumbered, outbudgeted and weakened from last election. So, apart from the bjp social media propaganda victims, everyone saw a man who makes mistakes but doesn't give up regardless of how much the odds are against him. And that makes him more human and relatable to common man. \n9. Dhruv Rathee - i don't like him because he's obviously biased and probably on Congress payroll but at the same time whatever he said about bjp is also 100% truth.\n10: Jarange Patil single handedly causing all maratha voters against bjp in marathwada.\n\n\nEdit: removed point 5 as would rather not interfere in ongoing investigation about the agrawal case without any proof.
