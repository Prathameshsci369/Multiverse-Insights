                "comment": "The ten years away is probably not far wrong. But to answer the question in all seriousness:\n\n- nisq devices: devices will have increased in size to ~1000s of qubits, though they *won’t be able to much more* than they can now (which is nothing at all) because without error correction it’s just not gunna happen and anyone telling you it’s useful in anyway is a stone-cold liar, no two ways about it; they know the truth, they’re trying to cheat you. Also, companies will still be selling their VQE solutions to problems which are solvable on classical devices because they’re charlatans. \n\n- error correction: I predict fault tolerance will have moved on a little bit, we’re pretty close to having an error corrected surface code now (though again, companies might tell you they have it now, looking you Google, they don’t, that’s a lie and we’re realistically about five to seven years away from having a chip which can real-time error correction in place), I expect there to be improvement in this area and by 2035 to have be able to actually do some basic three to five qubit circuits fault tolerantly.\n\n- compilation: this will help a number of things, I expect quantum compilers to be moving forward in the near future and hopefully in ten years this’ll be an effectively solved problem. I know that the QBI by DARPA has a strong focus on compilation which I hear there are some progress being made in Chicago with Fred Chong and in Australia with Simon Devitt on this. The smart money is obviously on Fred and their company, they have more money but Devitt is a gee, and some of the compilation stuff that Devitt’s group showed towards the end of DARPAs QB program was pretty impressive, we’ll see. \n\n- improvements to current algorithms: to reduce costs we need to understand costs. Cracking compilation will help there. Remember that all resource estimates that we can come up with now are upper bounds so hopefully with the Chong or Devitt compiler these can be improved upon.\n\n- genuinely new algorithms: I’m a little more pessimistic here because I just don’t believe there are many real problems that are in BQP but not BPP.",

Quantum machine learning is embryonic and might never become a thing (classical machine learning is already super good). Optimization has believers but needs real quantum computers to empirically check its usefulness (if any).\n\nI predict that in ten years there will 10x more research in quantum algorithms than today, driven by the despair of having quantum computers but nothing to run on them.

I’d guess we have QCs with a few thousand qubits, running small surface codes with gates getting logical errors down to like 10^-8(?) and a few dozen logical qubits. This would be really good! I also expect better resource estimation of algorithms, some improvements and one new actually good idea for a new algo. On the flip side, I could see some new physical phenomena arise that becomes a difficult hurdle for companies to cross. Also I bet like half of the companies go broke in 10 years because not enough progress is made",

The real issues are that:\n\n1. Progress has been painfully slow.  Major funding agencies have been holding conferences to discuss \"Should we cut our losses on this Quantum Computer stuff?\"  I was invited to one such meeting last year, in Alexandria, VA.\n\n2. The \"We only hire PhDs with a relevant thesis topic\" mentality is getting worse, not better.  The field is turning into a club, and the fact that we already have too many PhDs being produced does not help.\n\n3. I could be wrong about this.  A breakthrough could arrive out of Left Field tomorrow, but that is not the way to bet.  Even if , say, Psi Quantum manages to build a System-360 type Quantum Computer which creates thousands of jobs for Quantum Computer Programmers, the whole field would still be rather small.",

        "selftext": "*New post, now with screenshot.*\n\nMy background: PhD student in Physics, working on quantum information on the theory side. I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements (in Physics). I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.\n\n**Quantum communication doesn't allow for faster-than-light propagation of information**\n\nI have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem).\n\n**Breaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 10-20 years**\n\nYes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an n-bit number.\n\nAs an example for RSA-1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break real-world encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.\n\n**IonQ**\n\nThere's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and all-to-all connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback: the gate speeds.\n\nIt takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms (which Google, IBM uses). While finance/techbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see real-world use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.\n\nFurthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.\n\nAs a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a pay-by-the-minute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run (to be more tolerant of errors) to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.\n\n**Rigetti**\n\nHonestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for (allegedly) being a prick in general.\n\n**QUBT**\n\nLiterally never seen any substantial work from them.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8d3hedfi4rqe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c6f4e97de5dba5f0aa1ce08d44b6e959d16f03\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I've literally got my portfolio tied up in RKLB and LUNR because I don't know anything about space outside of Kerbal Space Program. I don't invest in quantum because I know quantum. I invest in space because I don't know space. Someone please make a similar post about space to convince me that space is bad too so I'll finally put my money into VOO and QQQ.",

This allows for some types of calculations to happen at exponentially faster rates (things that were considered impossible due to time constraints suddenly become simple). I'm sure there are a lot of very smart people putting together the formulas they want to run on quantum computers, but what we will actually be able to do with them once they are cost effective is yet to be seen. For now, people have been able to use creative methods to solve some problems with normal computers faster than existing quantum computers can manage, but that is expected to change as quantum computers improve and become affordable. And eventually people will come up with creative methods for quantum computers as well.\n\nOne thing we are already certain of is that solving the math used for many existing methods of encryption becomes trivial on a quantum computer. Many old, encrypted files and databases will suddenly be available to the world once quantum computers are affordable. Anything that has ever been leaked that was encrypted with most standard methods will be easily decrypted. There are certainly people holding onto piles of old data dumps, waiting for the day they can access them. Companies are slowly moving to encryption methods that we have not yet figured out how to quickly crack with quantum computers, but anyone who hasn't completed that by the time quantum computing is widely available is going to suffer. Also, due to the existence of old data dumps, anyone who hasn't changed their passwords in a while will be at risk regardless of updated encryption.\n\nHopes about solving real life issues in the world come down to predictions about what we will be able to model with the computers. They will very likely become standard for modeling molecular interactions of things involving both genetics and medicine, potentially leading to foods that grow more easily and cheaply and cures for all kinds of diseases.",

This includes RSA and ECC. \n\n\nBut most data isn't encrypted like that. Most data is encrypted with a symmetric algorithm such as AES. Shor's algorithm does not apply here. Instead, Grover's algorithm will have an impact, but it's not critical. Very broadly, AES-256's keyspace would go from 2^256 to 2^128, and AES-128 from 2^128 to 2^64.\n\n\nThe data most at risk in common use would be encrypted emails (PGP / S/MIME) and TLS / HTTPS traffic, including captured historical traffic. \n\n\nYour encrypted databases, ZIPs, bitlocker/truecrypt/dm-crypt'd drives? Those are fine.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Most encrypted data at rest does not become significantly easier to decrypt. Some specific subsets might, especially captured data in transit.",

Using big O notation, if an algorithm was O(N) for a standard computer, the best case is O(sqrt(N)) with quantum computers. The same is true if an algorithm was 0(N^2 ), now it would be O(N) with quantum computing. \n\nBasically quantum computers can solve these tasks in the square root of the time it takes for an algorithm on a traditional computer. While it could be argued that 1/2 is “an exponent”, most would agree that this isn’t the exponent they are talking about when saying “exponentially faster.”",

                "comment": "There's different classes of difficulty, regarding how hard a math problem (more accurately here, algorithm, is to solve). Some are easy, like checking if a sudoku game is solved: just check if the numbers don't repeat. Those are polynomial problems. Some are really hard, like actually solving sudoku: that's a non polynomial problem.\n\nModern traditional computers cannot solve non-polynomial problems. Or, well, they can, but it takes a LOT of time and energy (a non polynomial amount, actually).\n\nQuantum computers work differently. They're no faster than traditional computers for the easy (polynomial) problems, but they're capable of solving certain hard (non-polynomial) problems in a reasonable time. \n\nBesides sudoku, some noteworthy non polynomial problems are protein folding (which would impact drug production for example), and the prime factoring problem (which would break cryptography).\n\nThey're not faster computers, they're computers that solve different problems, problems for which we currently have no reasonable solutions",

Remember, companies in the space need investor money and have every incentive to over hype their progress. Sadly that's a common theme across the market as there seems to be only upside and no downside to companies doing this, it's really messed up.\n\nAnyway, investing in quantum computing companies now is the equivalent of going to a casino. Ie you're far more likely to loose money than gain. Have fun lolz",

(ie, it’s not a good field to go into)\n\nYou don’t need new novel algorithms for QC, at least not the way you imagine it. You mostly just need to be able to actually implement amplitude amplification, and doing that is a hardware problem. There is no great demand for QC programmers like there is for classical computers.\n\nIf you reallllly want to do something in QC, go get a physics / math dual degree then apply to PhD programs. You will not get there with just a bachelors or with a conventional CS education. If you want to improve your employment prospects then QC is not a good path to walk. \n\nI say this even though I have a computational physics background and strongly recommend that path through formal education to anyone who is at all interested in it. I believe it’s consistently the best undergraduate background possible for people in engineering and scientific fields. Even better if you get a masters in computational physics then move on to industry or a PhD in whatever field you actually care about. It’s a narrower path to walk, but you won’t hurt for employment if you do.\n\nYou say you want to have just a bachelors and focus on ML. You will likely be working on data pipelines and not actually doing ML work without at least a masters. Or rather, a masters is the easiest way to have a good chance of doing actual ML work. If you’re okay simply working *around* ML stuff, or transferring those skills to another domain (maybe general purpose SWE, maybe something idiosyncratic to you), then sticking with your current program is a reasonable choice. Just learning some numerical linear algebra (like your program will teach you) is a big competitive advantage, and despite what the doomers say the demand for general software engineering skills will remain high.",

There are jobs but they are primarily scientist positions because the field is so new. Otherwise, you will have to be even more of an expert in quantum logic and algorithms than the physicist are. \n\nThere are a vast number of extremely interesting things one could do with a QC with enough qubits, but it remains to be seen if systems of useful size will be feasible. That being said, it will probably be a long time until this determination can be made so there will be jobs in the field for a while. \n\nTake a look at some of the QC jobs and see if they look interesting to you. If you become an expert in the field, you'll probably be able to get a job, it's just a very high bar.",

It’s not impossible, but only in a technical sense.\n\nIf doing postdoc after postdoc in quantum electro chromodynamics in hopes of being hired by one of a handful of companies to work on something that miiiiight work someday (but you’re liable to die before it does) sounds like an acceptable trade off, go for it.\n\nEveryone else should stay far away from QC, except for like, I dunno, pleasure reading Nielsen and Chuang for their erudition.",

Quantum computing has something called qubits, you can think of qubits as your typical unpaid slave labor intern.\n\nNow, when you tell that overpaid double degree intern to do something do they do it? Or do they sneak off to the toilet for yet another quick wank?\n\n99.998% fidelity means that they only went wanking in 0.002% cases that you asked them to do something. So in the grand scheme of things that’s not too shabby.",

Generally a lot of what is available now is being explained through conventional computing techniques. And like it's a lot harder to imagine than we think, think trying to imagine the 4th dimension. \n\nThe main benefit is that at scale, multiple qbits can produce a shitton of combinations very quickly, much more than your regular old bits. Quantum entanglement means just have a lot of combinations or than the same bits can do multiple operations at once. Imagine your phone can launch one app at a time, so to shit post you need to turn of the trading app. Qbits could allow you to brainrot, shit post and loose all of your money all at once.  Now imagine calculating probabilities (like most GPT models do to give you trading advice). Qbits would simplify this and either allow for better quicker computation or more efficient one. Financial transactions? Even quicker. Solve the entire chess? Possibly. Predict TSLA stock prices? Not possible, Elmo is unpredictable. \n\nTldr: qbits fast at math. More math more better.",

The fermi hubbard model can't be solved on a classical computer, due to inherent antisymmetry in the wavefunction inducing \"the sign problem\" under exchange, which means all Monte Carlo methods fail. However, neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices can implement a trotterization rather directly, and bosonic qubits can still trotterize with some additional computational overhead. Make sense?\n\nMost of your comment indicates major misunderstandings of what quantum computation means and how it is useful, which I do not fault you for as there is more pop-sci pseudoscience on the topic out there trying to take your money than there probably is real science (as you've correctly noted). There is no faster than light communication, there is no \"computing all possibilities simultaneously,\" all of this is nonsense and you should ignore anyone who tries to tell you this. However, QCs do allow you to solve incredibly powerful physics and science problems. The results of that research will be extremely high impact, and that may or may not result in some big technological innovations down the line. Don't discard it completely just because there is a lot of people trying to sell you quantum supremacy BS who don't know what they're talking about.",

Like a nvidia gpu goes through billions of cases a second to find the solution. A quantum processor with the right algorithm and the right amount of input size just sharts out the right answer skipping the whole bothersome calculation shit. But since it’s quantum the answer you get is a bunch of weird ass waves + noise you need to decrypt. These nerds at MIT got somewhat of a low noise. Which is good.\n\nA no brainer thing that quantum could solve is protein folding and drug design. Right now we are making GPUs whine and try every single position and shape of a molecule like a regard. (And it’s not like a picture. It’s a video so you really have to go through the frames to figure out if your protein really would do that.) Quantum should theoretically be able to do this shit *really fast*.",
