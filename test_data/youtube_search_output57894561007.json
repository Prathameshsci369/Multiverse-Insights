        "transcript": "This chamber is the coldest place in the known universe. More than 40 times colder than interstellar space, but what's it actually cooling? Last week I got a call from Microsoft. I can't really share much on the phone, but we have something pretty incredible coming up that I think you'll want to see. Next thing I knew, I was on a plane to Seattle, hopping into a car, and before I knew it, inside a lab at an undisclosed location. It was here that I finally got to see what this was all about. It was here that I got to see the Myer-on-a-One. Microsoft's extreme breakthrough in quantum computing and the result of nearly 20 years of hard work. This team was able to control a subatomic particle that was only theorized until now, creating an entirely new material and a new architecture for quantum computing that's able to fit a million qubits onto this little chip. This thing would have more computation power in it than all the combined computation power in the past. Okay, but what does this actually mean? Well, a normal computer can only process things in bits, basically ones or zeros, whereas a quantum computer uses qubits that can be both in that one and zero state at the exact same time. Imagine a maze. A computer mouse has to go in each direction one at a time to find the end, but a quantum mouse can go in all directions at the same time. The more qubits you have, the more quantum mice you have that can explore these exponentially many paths at the same time, solving the maze much, much fast. To put this all in perspective, the largest quantum computer that we have right now has a little over a thousand qubits, and to expand this, it would take up football fields of space. But this new Myer-on-a-One chip will be able to house one million qubits in the palm of your hand.",

It's a bit complicated, but just like Bits are physically represented as the presence or absence of electricity, a Qubit has to be physically be represented by the presence or absence of an Electron in a certain point (oversimplified). The thing is that Electron are pretty unstable and the process is too sensitive, so they put it all in some layers of void space and the cool it down so the movement of the particles doesn't mess with the detection of the electron position (the majorana is this theorical subdivision of an electron that lets them measure the presence of the electron in that position).\nHope I explained myself",

(Yes, technically speaking you can do Shor on a 100qbit cpu but realistic no because of the fragility of entanglement). But a more realistic guess is probably somewhere between 7-15 years before quantum computers are that powerful.",

Quantum computers use wavefunctions that represent all the possible paths, which exist in superposition. In order to get these wavefunctions, you have to apply quantum gates to the qubits which is sort of like coding the maze game. In order to find the solution, they then will use mechanisms like interference to increase the chances of extracting the correct path while decreasing the chances of extracting an incorrect path. It's sort of like having a bucket filled with raffle tickets, and you shake the bucket in a certain way to push the correct ticket toward the top and increase your chances of picking it.",

Quantum Processing Units operate on principles of quantum mechanics, like superposition and entanglement, which allow them to process information in ways fundamentally different from classical CPUs or GPUs, not through analog signals but through discrete quantum states.\nThat said, you‚Äôre right that QPUs won‚Äôt directly give a ‚Äúbillion FPS‚Äù for gaming in the near future, as they‚Äôre not designed to replace GPUs for rendering tasks. However, quantum computing could potentially speed up FPS when paired with AI, particularly through techniques like interlaced predicted frames. AI frame prediction is already a reality (NVIDIA‚Äôs DLSS 3.0, which uses AI to generate intermediate frames and boost FPS). A QPU could enhance this by accelerating the AI‚Äôs inference process, for example, by optimizing neural network computations or evaluating multiple frame possibilities in parallel using quantum superposition. This could lead to faster and more accurate frame predictions, effectively increasing FPS without overburdening the GPU.\nAdditionally, if a game engine offloads physics calculations like ray tracing or fluid dynamics to a QPU, the rendering pipeline could become much faster. QPUs are particularly good at simulating complex systems, which could reduce the time spent on physics-heavy tasks and free up the GPU to focus on rendering, further boosting FPS. Of course, this is still speculative and depends on advancements like fault-tolerant quantum computers and new quantum algorithms tailored for real-time gaming workloads, which we‚Äôre likely years away from achieving. But the potential is there, and it‚Äôs an exciting direction to consider!",

The search agent will go through every path randomly until it ultimately reaches the destination. But you can't claim that it was the shortest or most efficient path to success until the entire space is covered. With a quantum computer, whenever the search agent encounters multiple paths, it will split and take both paths at once until it finds the fastest, most efficient path to success and all other search agents disappear. Now here are the two going up against each other. This is why you hear people saying that quantum computing will revolutionize the world because imagine AI progress in the next 10 years and you ask it to solve a problem, like how do we terraform another planet the fastest and safest way possible?

AI does not work in a way that can really profit from quantum computing either. AI is not looking for the best solution, it has no concept of quality of the output, it is looking for the most statistically likely solution, which mostly requires matrix multiplication math that a quantum computer would not be any faster at doing than a non-quantum one. Quantum computing is great in cases where you can phrase the mathmatical issue in a way where all incorrect answers destructively interfere with oneanother. So for your maze example, you&#39;d need a quantum computer with enough storage to represent the entire maze, and a (currently nonexistant) algorithm that could put that maze in a superposition of containing all possible paths at once, in such a way that all dead ends and paths longer than the shortest path destructively interfere, leaving only the shortest path as a possible solution when the maze is then observed.",

        "transcript": "Microsoft just announced their Myerana 1 quantum chip, the world's first topological quantum qubit array. In normal quantum computers you use qubits that can either be 0, 1, or somewhere in between the two. But your qubits are made of atoms, ions, or photons, so there's always a chance that a stray particle or random photon can bump into them, collapsing their quantum state. The research team at Microsoft's big idea was rather than hold this quantum information in a localized particle, instead to spread it across a surface or topology. They use Myerana quasi particles to hold electrons at either ends of a nanowire. This means that even if noise hits the system, the quantum state is still preserved. To make these nanowires work however required every single atom to be exactly in the right place within the material, which took the team 17 years to get right. Their nature paper just released which shows how powerful this technique is, and their architecture puts them on a pathway to realizing a million qubits that would fit on the size of a credit card. If you like science and tech breakthroughs, follow for more.",

        "transcript": "HIDDEN AMONGST THESE SNOW-COVERED HILLS is a secretive institution, home to a revolutionary machine that can harness physics so strange it sounds like magic. This is IBM's research facility, it's where some of the biggest breakthroughs in the history of computer science have happened and probably going to be home to a few more because this is where they build quantum computers. Their potential is huge, promising breakthroughs in material science, medicine, fundamental physics and more. But there is a dark side because they will come with the ability to decrypt all internet communication. Some say there is now a quantum arms race between the United States and its biggest economic rival, China. I'm Professor Hannah Fry, mathematician and writer. I want to know where quantum technology will take us and with international security under the threat, who will come out on top? This is the research headquarters for one of the oldest companies in tech, IBM. They've been inventing new computing technology here since the 1960s. It's like the Jetsons meets the Flintstones. Quantum scientist Olivia Lanez is showing me IBM's newest experimental machine. This big shiny behemoth is IBM Quantum System 2. Sounds like it's on. What is the big deal though? I mean, why not just build an ordinary supercomputer? It's a totally different avenue. It's not just supercomputers but better or AI but more powerful. It's an entirely different way of computing. The big difference is the computer's ability to harness the mysterious effects of quantum physics. Standard computers, they calculate by using billions of tiny little on and off switches known as bits. Now these things, they're very reliable. They work together in sequence. So if you ask a standard computer to solve a maze, it will do so by checking through every possible path one by one until it finds a solution. Depending on the size of the maze, that could take seconds or minutes or potentially for a really big maze even years. A quantum computer on the other hand works a little bit differently. There, the bits are known as quantum bits or qubits and rather than just being on or off, a qubit can be held in something called a superposition where it can be both on and off at the same time. Now, okay, I know that that doesn't really make a lot of sense but unfortunately that is just how physics works down at the atomic level. So go with me. This bizarre ability of a qubit to be in two states at once means that a series of qubits can solve lots of calculations simultaneously. And so if you ask a quantum computer to solve a maze, it means it can consider all possible routes at once, giving you the answer in an instant. It could allow a quantum computer to complete in minutes, computation so complex that it would take today's supercomputers millions of years. But that's not the only reason they're a game changer for science. I think what it really comes down to is that nature is quantum mechanical. When you get down to molecular and atomic interactions, nature does not obey classical physics. It's a very crude approximation. And if we really want to understand how nature evolves in time, we have to have a system that obeys quantum physics. So I guess this finally gives us the opportunity to do simulations down at the level of atoms. And when you have that, I mean, you can design drugs at the level of atoms. That's right. You can design materials, batteries. And we haven't had this before. We've never had that. I think when quantum computing comes up in conversation, people are excited about it but they're excited about the amount of power it gives you about how quickly you can do computations. Because, OK, sure, all of that stuff might be true. But we should be thinking of this as though someone has just invented the telescope. And all of a sudden, we can see and understand things at a scale that we just did not have access to before. That's the ambition, at least. Quantum computers cannot yet perform useful calculations better than a supercomputer. Because in practice, getting even a handful of qubits to give you a reliable answer is phenomenally difficult. Now you've got it. Oh, my God. Whoa! This is IBM's lab where they test out new hardware, a place where we can see the guts of the machine. Oh, that is extraordinary. This is what System 2 looks like inside. Yeah. What are we looking at then? I think a lot of people have a slight misconception and they see, you know, this whole gold, shiny thing and they think this is a quantum computer. That's actually not true. This is the quantum computer. So this tiny little thing, right? This is the Heron ship. This is the 133 qubits that I am holding in the palm of my hand. How much is that worth? A lot. Don't drop it. I'm going to try not to. The chip contains the qubits that carry out the computation and it's fair to say they're a little fussy. We're trying to change the energy state of the qubit between zero and one in a very controlled way. So any type of outside energy that might change it slightly in a way except for what we're trying to do will break your algorithm and give you the wrong answer. Mid energy includes any heat. To preserve the delicate quantum state of the qubit, the chip must be kept extremely cold. This tangle of gold-plated pipes and wires is in fact a cooling system that chills the chip to just above absolute zero. For comparison, the cosmic microwave background in space is way warmer. That's orders of magnitude warmer. Oh my goodness. So it is the coldest thing in the known universe. Which is inconferensivical. But these guys like it. They like it. Focus on your work. Stop paying attention to any of the energy around you. That's right. IBM say they'll unlock quantum's full potential by 2033. As you can imagine, it's been an expensive endeavor. Do you have any idea how much IBM will have spent on this quantum program? We haven't broken out, but I think it's fair to say it's like obviously many billions of dollars of investment. Our company spends close to seven billion dollars a year in R&D. And today in our world of technology, if you're not investing at that scale, it's very hard to be a global leader. But you do have competition. How much are you looking over your shoulder at what everyone else is doing? We pay keen attention to the entire ecosystem. But look, we take the perspective because we've been leaders and pioneers of this field and the goal is that we want an industry. We don't want to be alone on this. How much do you collaborate with other companies like Google and Microsoft who are also in this space? We collaborate a lot externally. For us collaborating on this is at the heart of making an ecosystem. It's back to the idea of creating an industry. Do you collaborate with Chinese companies as well? No, we do not. Go on. I think we acknowledge the fact that in this technology, in quantum, but we're seeing it happen by the way in other areas like semiconductors and so on, there is not only a big economic dimension, but there's a big national security implication as well. Quantum falls squarely within the category of sensitive technologies from that perspective. How important is it for the US to be the leaders in this? It's critically important. And I think that that is recognized in a bipartisan manner. One of the things we're witnessing is that we've seen the elevation of technology to the same level of geostrategic importance as trade or military alliances. Quantum computing is without a doubt one of the top technologies that the United States needs to lead. For now, the United States maintains supremacy in the development of quantum computers. But its biggest rival is fast catching up. China are betting big. They've invested over $15 billion, more than three times any other country. They have dozens of new research institutes committed to quantum and hold more than half of all patents in quantum technology. Hey. Hi there. How are you doing? Security expert Anna Puglisi has been advising the US government on how not to fall behind. China really does view science and technology as a national asset. It talks about not just leading, but dominating in these key areas. Does the US not see science as a national asset as well? I don't think we have the same kind of comprehensive strategic plan that brings together all facets of society and really has that longer term investment. What we are facing is it's not an even and level playing field. Our researchers are essentially up against the funding of a nation state. What are we talking about here in terms of the magnitude of difference of funding? Some examples that folks have given me is, OK, I have a lab. I have five to six, maybe four to six graduate students in my lab at any given time. There the equivalent labs have, you know, 50, 100 graduate students or postdocs. The US is hitting back. I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China. And thanks to our Chips and Science Act, the United States is investing more in real research and development than ever before. Whoever is the first to realise the potential of quantum computers will wield incredible power. But it's a double-edged sword because a world with quantum computers could be a world without secrets. Pretty much all internet communication is based on scrambling it using a secret code, otherwise known as encryption. And a lot of it uses a very clever mathematical trick involving prime numbers. We do. You take two prime numbers, let's say 17 and 31, and then you multiply them together to give you a code, in this case, 527. Now, that bit is very straightforward, very easy for computers to do that, multiply numbers together. What is much harder is if you only have the long number working out what those two secret primes were. The only way that you can do this with classical computers is by checking through all the prime numbers just to see if they work one after the other after the other. A common type of encryption, RSA, uses prime numbers that are hundreds of digits long. To crack those codes, it would take a conventional computer trillions of years. And that's really the obstacle of encryption. It's not this impossible. It just takes a really, really long time. This is where quantum computing comes in, because quantum computers using superposition can simultaneously run numerous calculations at the same time and can take something like this down to being crackable within just a few minutes. It means that encrypted data could be hacked in no time. Few are more afraid of a mass global data breach than the banking industry. Dr Philip Intellura is head of quantum technology at HSBC. We process ¬£3.5 trillion worth of payments every year, so cryptography is a big deal for us. How much of a catastrophe would this be if people just sat back and did nothing? Well, ultimately you're going to have customers' accounts being breached, which means things like identity theft and fraudulent transactions. Money being stolen. Money being stolen. That's then going to roll into financial losses. Customers will lose money. The banks will lose money. But I think ultimately the biggest risk of all is the element of trust. If customers can't trust their banks, they'll lose money. If they trust their bank to keep their accounts and their money secure as well as their data, then it's kind of an existential risk. Yeah, I mean that is a fundamental part of banking. Can you be absolutely sure that this hasn't happened already? I mean, okay, if I had a quantum computer, I could read everything. I'm not sure I would tell people about it. No, you probably wouldn't. I think it's very unlikely that anyone's got a quantum computer powerful enough right now to do this, but there may be something called a store now to cripple later or harvest now to cripple later type of attack. And this is kind of the idea that state actors or malicious entities right now can start intercepting our data and storing it and just keeping it ready for the time, the point in time when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives. Are we talking about a national security consensus here? Is that ultimately where the big worry is? That's probably the number one area that we should be concerned about because, you know, state actors are most likely going to target national security kind of infrastructure to scrape and decipher information. State secrets will be uncovered. You'll know who all the spies are. You'll know who all the spies are. If you suddenly lose that secrecy and that security, then it causes all sorts of unrabilities on a personal level, on a national level, from a security perspective, from a commercial perspective. And so, you know, this is a big, big deal. HSBC say that doing nothing is simply not an option. The bank has been testing a way to secure its data against an attack from quantum computers. Internet data today is sent by laser pulses in an optical fiber. This is Dr Andrew Shields, head of quantum technology for Toshiba. In general, fiber networks are very secure, but they are vulnerable to tapping. If I introduce a small bend into the fiber, you can see some of the light is not leaking out. And actually, a hacker can use that. They can introduce a small bend to tap out some of the light and measure that to recover the data. So that's all you need then, is just access to the cable. Indeed, it's very straightforward. Goodness me. Andrew has built a device that utilizes the strange world of quantum physics to send data in a way he claims can never be hacked. It's called quantum key distribution. This is it. This is it, yes. What this box is doing is it's sending single photons through an optical fiber into the BT network. And we use that to form encryption keys. And those encryption keys are then being used to secure data sent between here and the data center in Berkshire. The device generates a secret code using single particles of light, photons, which are sent one at a time down a fiber optic cable. A fundamental law of quantum physics is that if you observe a photon, you change its quantum state. And that means that if an eavesdropper tries to intercept the key, the code will be changed, rendering it unusable. The device already uses Telecom company BT's existing fiber network to send sensitive files across London to a data center over 30 miles away. Tell me about the information that you're sending using this method at the moment then. So in the case of HSBC, it's financial data. But we've done other trials with hospitals, for instance, where they've been sending medical scan data. Or with governments where they've been sending some government data. Do you feel the sense of urgency for companies, even though we're not quite there yet with quantum computers? Yes, they absolutely are. There's an increasing realization that the quantum computer is coming. How far away do you reckon it is? Well, now that's a very difficult question to answer. If I was a betting man, maybe I would say five to seven years. There are no maybes here. It's not if this is going to happen, it's when it's going to happen. And it's the total acceptance that when it happens, our existing communication systems are no longer fit for purpose. And that puts you in a position where you have no choice, no choice, but to find something else that works and is secure. Some have made more progress than others. In 2016, China shocked the world by launching a satellite capable of sending quantum keys over far greater distances than fiber optics. It's part of a wider quantum network that China has built, connecting banks, government and industry across the country, leaving other nations scrambling to catch up. On the gleaming streets of Singapore, the quantum revolution has found fertile ground. Scientists here want to build an unhackable network that can be commercialised so anyone can use it. Professor Alexander Ling runs the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, a government-funded group of scientists working on all sorts of quantum technology. They told me that I would get to see some nano-satellites. I think this is even more nano than I was expecting. This is over 200 times lighter than China's quantum satellite. Okay, tell me about the experiment then. What's the big aim? The big goal over here is we want to build a global network where we can actually distribute quantum signals around the world. We can distribute quantum signals using optical fiber, except that there's a distance limit to it. We can't repeat those quantum signals. So we think that if you have satellites with optical fiber networks, you can actually build a more comprehensive network around the world. So then when you send up a rocket, you presumably have a number of days to put them out where you want them to take? Yes, what we're doing in Singapore is to test whether similar technology can go on much smaller satellites. You can imagine that if it works, you can have a fleet of smaller satellites that's more cost-effective, and then make sure the deployment of such a system more likely. His plan is to fire single photons into space and back again via a network of satellites and telescopes. These quantum keys would provide unhackable global communications. So this is your fancy photon catcher. That's right. This is the telescope that's going to receive the signals from the satellite. Long distance communication is just one part of Professor Ling's work. They also collaborate with US and Chinese companies. Quantum technology was developed in an era when international relations were more relaxed and it was put that way. It started in the late 80s, early 90s and everyone was open to having an exchange of people and ideas at that time. Has that desire for collaboration continued or has it been sort of shut down a bit more because of the geopolitical situation we find ourselves in? I think definitely everyone's aware that there's tension, geopolitical tensions, and people from time to time talk about export controls and things like that. Everybody seems to have high expectations for when quantum technology will deliver those benefits. If you come in with controls too early before a lot of the problems are worked out, you are probably going to be pushing the date of deployment, the date when you see those benefits, much further into the future. I'm kind of squashing the innovation as it's happening. That's right. Scientists understand how quantum computers could supercharge their discoveries. Banks and governments see the risks and the potential for economic growth. But will a high stakes duel for supremacy really define the future of global power? I think the rhetoric around this is always framed as a quantum race, right? Between two giant superpowers who are throwing everything they have at it. But I sort of don't think that this is like races that we've had before. I don't think this is like the space race or the nuclear arms race, because I don't think that we're in a situation where you can only have one winner. The quantum future is about building a scientific tool that allows us to see and understand the universe down at the level of atoms in a way that we have just never had access to before. And okay, maybe I'm just being optimistic, but I think that that is something that all of humanity will stand to benefit from.",

The programmed signals we use to excite a quantum device should more or less match its resonating frequency and thus typically take the form of continuous, modulated sine waves. (In other words, square waves are not suitable to excite a physical qubit, however a compatible digital-to-analog converter may be employed to generate the required resonating waveform). <br><br>The manipulation of waves in the quantum confined devices, under the right conditions, is what allows one to obtain the interference, entanglement, and superposition for the quantum experiments :)<br><br>- a quantum hardware engineer who builds quantum computers for a living",

That‚Äôs why Neil is so proud here, Chuck doesn‚Äôt have a comparable science background, he‚Äôs a comedian, but after being around Neil so long he‚Äôs begun to understand science more and more.",
