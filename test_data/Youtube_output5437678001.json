        "transcript": "Hello friends, only one stupid politician can make a single world proud. Today, we are able to see his winning face. It is the second April of 2025 when Donald Trump announced his presidential tariffs. He put more than 90 countries on the world and said in his typical Nautangh style. Not more. Many countries have. They've ripped us off left and right. In his opinion, the rest of the world was looting America for a long time. America, which is the richest country in the world, was being ripped off by the rest of the countries. But now it's our turn to do the ripping. As soon as he announces, he immediately gets into the share markets of the world. Trillions of dollars go into the market within a week and global recession is in the world. The world taters on the edge of a potential global recession. On the 7th April, the most dangerous day for the stock market was in Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Japan, Germany, UK, US, India. The stock market fell very fast. The things here are so weird and strange and handled in a way that I would like to show you an example of this. On the 2nd April, Donald Trump announced a 34% tariff on China. After two days, China announced its tariff on America on its 34%. Donald Trump doesn't like this. Trump threatens China and says, Take this tariff off. If he doesn't remove it, I'll put another 50% off. That tariff isn't removed by tomorrow at 12 o'clock. We're putting a 50% tariff on above the tariffs that we put on. But China keeps on fighting on its own and on 9th April, America puts another 50% tariff on China. And in the response, China also puts another 50% tariff on America. This is how TIT for TAT is being played between these two countries. Now, there's a trade war happening here. Let's understand this whole situation in depth in this video. Before I start this video, I'd like to tell you that the spots have been opened up for this month's AI Masterclass. This is a 2.5-hour live workshop that I did last month. I personally come live and teach you about 20 different AI tools. In this, chat, GPT, DeepSeek, Mid Journey, Leonardo AI, Dream Studio, Runway ML 11 Labs, many new Chinese AI's, Hailu AI, Kling AI, here you can create an image generation, video generation, AI through this website, create songs through AI and learn a lot more. The last months that they attended the AI Masterclass, you can see their reviews here on the screen. This is a very big and affordable opportunity to upskill you in AI because its cost is just as much as two movie tiktos. If you haven't been able to join this last time, you can join today. The link is in the description below and you'll get it in the QR code. The exact date and time is also mentioned in this link. If you can't attend this exact date and time, you can watch this workshop recording for the next three days. Now, let's come to our topic. Let's start with the basics, friends. What is a tariff? A tariff is a kind of tax. That tax is applied on the things that come from abroad. If you buy an iPhone, a smartphone outside of India, then it is applied 15% import tax by the Indian government. Import tax is a type of tariff. On things like clothes, 20-25% import is applied. Import duty is also a type of tariff. There are mainly two reasons behind applying tariffs. First is to increase the government's revenue. Like other taxes, this is also a way to earn the government. And second reason is to protect local industries. Because by applying tariffs, the things that come from abroad become expensive. And the things that are made in our country are cheaper compared to that. So, people buy more things from their country. That's why, local industries get a bigger profit. Many countries apply tariffs for this reason, which is not wrong. In fact, if tariffs are applied smartly, then the economy of the country is also beneficial. As a example, South Korea's country, where farmers had to face big problems in the 1980s and 1990s. Their farmers had no more modern technology than that. So, the price of rice in their country was much cheaper than that. America, Thailand and Vietnam could import rice. So, South Korea applied tariffs very strategically to save the livelihood of its farmers. They said that there is a small limit. If we import rice to that limit, then there will be no tariffs in our country. But if we import more rice than that, then there will be a lot of tariffs. More than 500% tariffs will be applied. What happened with this? The rice that came from abroad became expensive. And the farmers of the country got the opportunity to be competitive. Gradually, they started using modern technology. Like their government spent money on rural infrastructure and education. After a few decades, when their farmers reached that level, they gradually removed tariffs. Now, think about it. If tariffs were not applied here, what impact would they have on their farmers? The entire local farming sector gets destroyed. And on a large scale, poverty and unemployment are seen. So, it is known that tariffs are not wrong in itself. But the question is here, what is the way tariffs are applied, which things are applied, which countries are applied. Because think about things from a different perspective. Think from the perspective of that country. Which is exporting its goods to another country. Imagine that India exports a lot of medicines to South Korea. It exports so much medicines that South Korea is the largest consumer of the medicines of India. And suddenly, South Korea puts a 100% tariff on the medicines that come from India. South Korea says that they have to promote their local medicines industries. How will India feel in this situation? India will not be happy at all. Especially if the biggest consumer of India's medicines is South Korea. Because the industry of India will end. If South Korea doesn't sell the medicines of India. This is the reason that when a country protects its local industry, it can also harm another country. And there are many cases where the other country doesn't like this. And the other country gets angry and puts tariffs on the first country. This way, a tariff war can start, which can be called a trade war. This is a simple way to avoid it. Negotiate with another country. Talk to another country. This is our problem. That's why we want to put tariffs on it. And if you understand the other country, you will be able to get a solution. Which is beneficial for both. Maybe you can say that you can put tariffs on our medicines. But after a limit, so that we can sell more medicines in your country. Talking friendly is a big important word. Donald Trump has suddenly put tariffs on 90 countries without talking to anyone. And that too with full attitude. I will do whatever I want. We are going to have to go through a little tough love maybe. But they all understand. They are ripping us off and they understood it. So obviously, many countries are not happy with this. And they started putting tariffs in retaliation. On their own, Donald Trump said that he put tariffs on it. So that I can reduce the trade deficit of America. That's why the day he put tariffs on it, he gave the name of Liberation Day. Now you will ask what is the trade deficit. Let's take the example of two countries. One is America, the other is China. Suppose the total amount that America is exporting to China is worth $1 billion. And the total amount that China is exporting to America is worth $2 billion. So here, the trade deficit of $1 billion of 2-1 America is. The difference between export and import. Now, there is no bad thing in yourself to have a trade deficit here. If you look at it from above, it is said that the trade deficit is bad because your country is depending on another country. But if your country's economy is strong, many countries' investments are coming into your country. And there is no such critical thing that you are depending on another country, then the trade deficit is not a bad thing. But Trump thinks that America's trade deficit is a bad thing. And to remove this trade deficit, he said that he put tariffs on it. And to put tariffs on it, he used emergency powers. I am not joking. He announced a national emergency to make the trade deficit. They are a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life. Experts say that it is not right to misuse the emergency act in this way for democracy. But now let's take a look at the tariffs that Trump has put. A big board was standing, Donald Trump, in which various tariffs were written for different countries. In this, at least 10% of the tariffs imported from every foreign object in America have been put. This 10% tariff has been put on those countries too, with which America is not in the trade deficit. The rest of the Trump has made excuses that many countries put tariffs on the things that come from America. So the Trump tariffs are actually reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal, that means they do it to us and we do it to them. Look at the list here. Cambodia 49%, Vietnam 46%, 20% tariff on the European Union. Taiwan 32%, South Korea 25%, India 26%. Israel 17%. After the treat for tax with China, the tariffs on China have reached 125%. On the other hand, China has also put the tariff on America for 125%. The interesting thing is how exactly the numbers were calculated. A very simple formula was used here. The trade deficit with any country in America was divided from the imports that came from that country. And the percentage that came, Trump gave it the tariff of that country and put half of it. And because we are being very kind, we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us. Like with China, the trade deficit of the US is $295 billion. And the things that China imports from America are of $439.9 billion. According to the formula, the percentage here is 67%. So the trade deficit between the two countries is 67%. But now Trump has gone to a very foolish thing here. Trump said that this 67% is the number that is putting tariffs on the US. Which is not at all. And by telling him the tariff, he put half of it to 34%. This was done with all the countries. And I don't understand that the people around Trump did not notice this. This is a formula that will be understood by a primary school kid. But no, Trump crossed all the limits of foolishness when he put tariffs on some uninhabited islands near Antarctica. The Hurt Island and the McDonnell Island are some islands near Antarctica where no one lives. No one has ever been there in the past 10 years. Only penguins live on that island. But on that island, Trump also put a 10% tariff. Let's see the reaction of the penguins after Trump's announcement. No seriously, these islands are so isolated that to reach here, you have to travel two weeks from Australia. And no one has been here in the past 10 years. Has Trump seen the name of this island, McDonnell Island? And he understood that this is the Disneyland of McDonald's. Anyway, the joke is on one side, but the reality of the tariffs is being impacted. America is a very big consumer market. And the world is full of people. And the world is full of people. And the world is full of people. America is a very big consumer market. And small businesses around the world depend on selling their goods to American consumers. That's why many countries have put tariffs on their retaliations to fight against America. China, European Union and Canada have intentionally targeted those places in the Caribbean where Trump gets the most votes in America. Like China targeted farmers and car makers in the desert. Canada put tariffs on poultry farms and AC manufacturers. Europe put tariffs on steel mills and slaughterhouses. These are the sectors where the people who support Trump and vote for him are the most people. The logic is simple here. If you want to harm them, then you have to harm those people who voted for this stupid politician. Trust me, I'm like a smart person. Actually, putting tariffs on so many different countries all of a sudden, without talking to them, it will be a loss. And the loss is on both sides. The country where the goods were coming from, will depend on the businesses of that country. People will buy less of their goods. But in your own country, when the things outside are expensive, and not just one or two things, but almost everything, when it becomes expensive, then the pain will fall on a common man's pocket. The most loss of Trump's tariffs will be on American people because today we live in a globalized world. In America, whatever goods are sold in most cases, or they are made from outside, or the small parts that are in it, whether it is raw materials or ingredients, they are made from outside. Take the example of Mr. Beast, he tweeted that chocolate he made and said that it is made in America. But the cocoa beans that are made to make chocolate, they come from outside. From countries like Africa. And if tariffs increase, then it will be more expensive to bring raw materials to make chocolate. That will increase the price of chocolate. That's why he wrote in the tweet, after tariffs, actually, it will be more expensive to make chocolate out of America. If we look at history too, when America has put tariffs in this way, without thinking, broadly, on many things, on many countries, its loss has to be endured by America itself. This year in 1789, the first president of America, George Washington, brought a tariff act, in which 5% tax was put on imported goods. But in the year 1890, tariffs were increased on a very large scale. On more than 1500 goods, 49.5% tax was put on it. William McKinley, who was behind these tariffs, who is also called Napoleon of Protectionism. Trump considers them his hero. But what happened because of these tariffs? In 1893, depression came to America. The unemployment rate reached 25%. After 1910, when Democrats came to power, who supported free trade, they lowered tariffs, so that they could see the economic growth in America rapidly. But in 1920, the Republican Party comes to power again, and to protect farmers and industries, tariffs are increased again. In 1930, Republican President Herbert Hoover brought a smooth holy tariff act. In this, tariffs in every sector increased by more than 20%. And what happened after this? The rest of the country was not happy. The rest of the country retaliated for this. They put their retaliatory tariffs on it. And after this, international trade fell down all over the world. From 1929 to 1934, global trade decreased by 66%. In 1929, the Great Depression came. There was something else behind it, but the situation became worse and worse. The credit goes to these tariffs. For about 10 years, the entire American economy and global economy was going down. This was only in 1939, when the Second World War started, where factory production started to increase in America. And then America was out of this depression. America has always been increasing free trade since the Second World War. The rest of the country has always said, keep your tariffs low. The less tariffs you have, the more international trade you will get. The more benefits you will get to each country. According to this philosophy, World Trade Organization, WTO, which is a platform for negotiation for countries all over the world. Even today, if you go to the Wikipedia page of WTO, there is a purpose section. See what it says. Reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade. The purpose behind making WTO is to reduce tariffs worldwide. And in making this international organization and increasing it, America is playing a leading role. But now, after Donald Trump came, all things have become upside down. The rest of the world doesn't know how much trust America has in America. What is the truth in America? The Prime Minister of Singapore gave an interesting statement about it. Listen to this. Singapore will take a bigger hit than others because of our heavy reliance on trade. The last time the world experienced something like this was in the 1930s. Trade wars escalated into armed conflict and eventually the Second World War. No one can say how the current situation will unfold in the coming months or years. But we must be clear-eyed about the dangers that are building up in the world. Global institutions are getting weaker. International norms are eroding. More and more countries will act based on narrow self-interest and use force or pressure to get their way. This is the harsh reality of our world today. They say that when they saw a huge scale of trade war, they had armed conflicts and later the Second World War. It's difficult to predict what will happen next. The world's economy is going through a very unpredictable time. Donald Trump's behavior is responsible for this unpredictability. On 9th April, Trump has been pausing tariffs against all countries for 90 days and has reduced it to just 10%. Except China. Tariffs have been increased to China. I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate. And that's what I did with China because they did retaliate. So, every day, tariffs are going up and down and people are confused about what Donald Trump wants to do. What do you think, friends? Write in the comments below. You may not even know Trump himself because he may not know what he wants to do. Some people also use the stock market manipulation as an excuse. When he suddenly used the tariffs, the stock market fell. But the day he removed the tariffs, before removing the tariffs, he tweeted, It's a very good time to invest money in the stock market. He knew that as soon as the tariffs were removed, the stock market would go up again. And here, he was posting and telling his followers to buy it. As soon as he announced the news of the pause of the tariffs, the stock market suddenly went up. This stock market manipulation has a very simple and clear proof. But the question arises, who will dare to investigate the president of America? And the question is, after investigating, what is the judge who will dare to give a judgment against Donald Trump? Now, one theory arises here, that Donald Trump took such a big U-turn so quickly because he did not expect that the world would react this way with his tariffs. If this is the case, then Trump's incompetence looks clear. But if it is not, some people say that this was Trump's first plan. Trump was playing 4D chess here. Before that, he would put so many tariffs in front of the world. Then he would remove everyone. But he would let the tariffs of China remain. This was a move to trap China. So Trump's incompetence looks clear from this. Because in this way, it is not a game to put tariffs, remove them on such a large scale. Millions of small businesses in the world are affected by this. Millions of businesses who are unable to decide their products properly, because they do not know what tariffs will be put on them tomorrow. How much will they affect their profit from that tax? Will they be profitable or not? It has happened that you should set fire to the whole house to kill a cockroach in your house. That is the logic of demonetization. But even more than that, 10 times worse. I hope you found this video informative. Friends, the link to join the AI Masterclass will be in the description and pinned comment below. And if you want to understand the childish acts of Trump a little deeper, then watch this video where I have talked about the meeting of Trump and Zelensky. What such stupid behavior affects international relations? You can watch it by clicking here. Thank you very much.",

In the long term, the tariffs will bleed the other countries fairly dry if they don't want to play ball. Their economy isn't robust enough to keep up. So eventually, we either get more money back from our tariffs, or they capitulate to whatever terms are being demanded. \n\nThis isn't about Trump, it's about America's economic power. Our youth believes the lies of the EU and globalists, that America is some sloppy, lazy, uncouth, uncivilized Nation of Little consequence. But without us they'd be German. They forget that they asked us to prevent another Hitler or Stalin, and promised to pay us for that protection. Our debt wouldn't exist if NATO paid its dues, and our military is still massively larger than all of theirs. In a 1v1, we would ALWAYS win, yet they all act like petulant children and double down, like Zelinski, like Trudeau, etc.",

The tariff on bananas would be representative of the countries that produce them. And what's that tariff? Generally 10%. Correct. 10%. Walmart has already increased the cost of bananas by 8%. As countries do deals without stable goods zero out. The cost is on the American consumer now and on the businesses with the confusion now. There's no uncertainty if you build in America and you produce your product in America, there will be no tariff. So the concept of building in America and paying no tariff is very, very clear. We cannot build bananas in America.",

Whatever tariff revenues will come will goes into 37T debt interest payments. If left something, we all know where it will go. \nAlso, when we say tariff revenues, who pays that tariff? 99% people or say Americans think that foreign countries pay 😂😂 sorry that’s why education is important. American importers pay to American government that tariff and later pass it on to customers. So ultimately Americans have now income tax rate hike, indirectly in terms of price hikes😂😂.",

We pay them $5/hour to make iphone.  Why would apple ever build iphone in the USA paying $20/hour? It just doesn't make any sense. Jobs are not coming back no matter how much tariffs we put on.

There is NO tax until the goods arrive in the country imposing the Tariffs (USA).  The Importer can choose to pass on the charge or pay themselves.  At no point does the provider pay anything.  The only problem they have is that you will not be able to afford as much because Trump has raided YOUR bank account.",

How do you think tariffs will impact inflation? Over time, there are tax on goods. I mean, the tooth fairy doesn't pay up. I mean, and you always have to just, and then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. Always say, and then what? So is there an answer for that when people say, you know, inflation persists, consumer prices keep going up, when's the end in sight? No, prices will be higher, 10 years from now and 20 years from now and 30 years from now. And what do you think about what's happening in Washington right now about efforts to cut the... I think it's Washington. It's, you know, technology changes things, all kinds of things, but Washington is Washington.

The only reason the US has them at all are because A) we have a larger population than many of our trade partners B) we have more money than our trade partners and C) we buy parts and materials from other countries that we simply don’t have available here even when we do manufacturing in the country. \n\nIt was a system that benefited both countries, now adding tariffs to imports is only going to raise prices across the board. Modern US infrastructure isn’t designed for heavy across the board manufacturing, that will take billions of investments along and a decade to even become competitive there. \n\nAll heavy, broad tariffs will do is gouge consumers, start trade wars and create a recession.",

If Elise Stefanik of New York resigns to go to the UN, her seat will also be filled by special election.\n\nThough many think the two Florida seats will be easily won by Republicans, recent polling indicates neither is a slam dunk.  If all three seats are won by Democrats, then the House Leadership changes.\n\nIf any Senate Republican were to decide to listen to their constituents vs trying to appease Trump, a gigantic shift would happen.  That first Republican would find him/herself backed up by members of both parties.  In years to come that first one to speak out for what is right would be regaled as a true patriot.  200 years from now the history books would highlight the legacy of that brave person.  \n\nOr I’m just dreaming. ^sigh^",

My friend, Mr. Dolan Trump. What is the outcome of all this? Today Trump is insulting India. Sometimes he is insulting 25% of the population, sometimes he says that India is an economy dead, sometimes he says that India is not a country worth considering. And don't say that we know Trump will be like this. The people who were sensible, everyone knew what level of hate Trump is. It is fraud and false politics. I have criticized him in my videos. But he made Trump his second father. Only because he hates Muslims. Donald Trump. Great again. If anyone can save Manapta, then it is Donald Trump. And now they are doing the same with Israel. Israel is only supporting Israel because it is against the Muslims. Remember one thing, As much as you support a hateful politician in the yard of hatred, you will get hatred in return. And this is not just about India. This is the state of the world's far-right politicians. Supporting them means killing the bull on your own feet. Today the Americans are also enjoying Trump. If you think that this hatred is spreading only towards other people, and you will be saved in some way, it will be good for you. Don't stay in this illusion. This fire of hatred will burn everyone's house.",
