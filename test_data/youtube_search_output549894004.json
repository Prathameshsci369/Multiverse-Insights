        "transcript": "If you are thinking of buying gold, be careful because the price of gold can drop to 5000 rupees per gram and the reason behind this is Trump. How? In 2024, when the tension between the Russian-Ukraine war and the world increased, the work of buying gold started in all the central banks of the world including India. The purpose of all this was to prevent the trust of paper money in the current situation. Because of this, the prices of gold started increasing all over the world. In 2022, gold was getting 50,000 rupees per gram but in the last 3 years, it has reached 50,000 rupees per gram to 90,000 rupees per gram which is the highest so far. Now, America is ready to sell its reserves of gold at this high price. Everyone knows that the world's most gold reserve, 8000 tons of gold is with America. Trump will sell a lot of gold from America's gold reserves and buy cryptocurrency in return. Because now, Trump has announced the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in America. When America will sell gold at a high price and buy Bitcoin, after Bitcoin dollar, it will become the second largest international trading currency. Then who will ask about gold? And the prices of gold will start falling. America will pay the world's businessmen and countries in Bitcoin and demand in Bitcoin. In this situation, the prices of gold and dollar will start falling. America will not be affected because the gold has already been sold at a high price. The whole world is looking for a solution for the dollar because they need something to trade. And then the easiest solution will be Bitcoin which will already be with America. And after that, the prices of Bitcoin will start increasing. And then the loss from the dollar will be covered by Bitcoin. But the real effect of this will be on gold. After the price of gold keeps falling, there will come a time when the gold you bought in 90,000-95,000 per 10 grams, its price will be only 50,000 per 10 grams. And then gold will be wasted instead of the best. If you still don't understand what the plan is, then watch this video again. This is going on. Do write in the comment section how you liked this video. See you in the next video. Till then, follow and subscribe.",

        "transcript": "Over the past few months, the price of gold has been going haywire. You can see it on this chart. As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, the price crashed alongside stocks, and then quickly regained. Then a frenzy of investment drove up the price to all-time highs. On August 4th, it shot past $2,000 a troy ounce for the first time ever, before another week of big swings. This volatility is drawing both Main Street and Wall Street investors seeking fast gains, and leading some analysts to call it a modern-day gold rush. But these big moves call into question gold's reputation as a safe haven asset. Prices can move at a moment's notice without fundamental reason. More volatility means more risk, and that means gold isn't the haven necessarily that some people think it is. To understand why the price of gold is so volatile, first you need to understand how gold trading works. Like other precious metals, the price of gold is tied to physical assets. The physical gold market involves mining, refining, travel, and sales. Gold mining happens on every continent, except Antarctica. In the top producing countries are China, Russia, and Australia. This work adds up to about 2,500 to 3,000 metric tons of gold each year. This metal is then smelted and refined before being turned into bars, coins, and other products like jewelry. The gold is then shipped around the world, often stashed in the cargo of commercial aircrafts. Much of it is sent to London. Mostly hidden beneath the streets of the city, the Bank of England's vaults hold around 400,000 bars of gold, worth over $260 billion. The physical trading of gold in London is done behind closed doors and in secret by a few banks. So these banks work with the London Bullion Market Association to set the physical price of a troy ounce of gold, and that price determines how much gold is worth everywhere. The gold stash in London is rivaled only by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which holds the world's largest hoard of physical gold. In other places around the world, gold is a common investment as well. In a lot of cultures in Asia, people see gold as something that's having prestige and intrinsic value that can be passed down from generation to generation. That can be a big source of physical demand for jewelry and bars and coins. When individual investors want to buy in, they generally have a few options. They can purchase physical gold in person from dealers or on websites like APMEX. They can bid on thousands of dollars worth of gold through eBay. And they can buy exchange traded funds that hold physical metal. The biggest of these is SPDR Gold Shares, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But this is just the physical market. Gold is also traded on a whole different market that is tied to commodity futures. This takes us back to New York, where gold futures trade on the ComEx division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are contracts which lock the price of a commodity that will change hands at a specific future date. A standard futures contract is tied to 100 ounces of gold, worth over $200,000, depending on the market. The most actively traded month for gold futures right now is December, because that's a month people expect the pandemic's issues to maybe be resolved by. And it's a month around November's presidential election. A lot of people are very nervous about the outcome of that election and that it might be delayed. So they're using these December gold futures to give themselves options and protect against market turmoil. But gold has slipped lately after a long run up, a reminder that momentum in this market can change quickly. Still, this hasn't stopped gold bugs. And there are a few reasons why people continue to pile money into the metal right now. For a lot of investors, it started in March when mines, refineries and airlines shut down across the world, upending the system usually used to move gold across the Atlantic and stabilize prices. But when the pandemic hit, investors feared there wouldn't be a way to physically move gold between the markets. This caused physical gold purchases to soar, leading to a severe shortage that drove up the price of futures. But there are other reasons, too. There are a lot of people who are very bullish on gold and think it's an alternative currency that provides a hedge against inflation and is very attractive when interest rates are low. Many bulls are piling into the sector because they think the Federal Reserve and other central banks are eroding the value of paper money by pumping a ton of cash into the global financial system to support the economy. The increased activity is contributing to momentum trading, driving a frenzy for gold similar to stocks. But if inflation doesn't materialize, the momentum that gold is seeing could unravel. Analysts say the current trading environment is extremely risky. People say all of the economic and political instability could last for a lot longer than we think. At the same time, if the economic recovery goes better than expected, if there's a coronavirus vaccine more quickly than we think, gold could have some issues. This means that gold could face more volatility moving forward.",

Gold is also traded on a whole different market that is tied to commodity futures. This takes us back to New York, where gold futures trade on the ComEx division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are contracts which lock the price of a commodity that will change hands at a specific future date. A standard futures contract is tied to 100 ounces of gold, worth over $200,000, depending on the market. The most actively traded month for gold futures right now is December, because that's a month people expect the pandemic's issues to maybe be resolved by. And it's a month around November's presidential election. A lot of people are very nervous about the outcome of that election and that it might be delayed. So they're using these December gold futures to give themselves options and protect against market turmoil. But gold has slipped lately after a long run up, a reminder that momentum in this market can change quickly. Still, this hasn't stopped gold bugs. And there are a few reasons why people continue to pile money into the metal right now. For a lot of investors, it started in March when mines, refineries and airlines shut down across the world, upending the system usually used to move gold across the Atlantic and stabilize prices. But when the pandemic hit, investors feared there wouldn't be a way to physically move gold between the markets. This caused physical gold purchases to soar, leading to a severe shortage that drove up the price of futures. But there are other reasons, too. There are a lot of people who are very bullish on gold and think it's an alternative currency that provides a hedge against inflation and is very attractive when interest rates are low. Many bulls are piling into the sector because they think the Federal Reserve and other central banks are eroding the value of paper money by pumping a ton of cash into the global financial system to support the economy. The increased activity is contributing to momentum trading, driving a frenzy for gold similar to stocks. But if inflation doesn't materialize, the momentum that gold is seeing could unravel. Analysts say the current trading environment is extremely risky. People say all of the economic and political instability could last for a lot longer than we think. At the same time, if the economic recovery goes better than expected, if there's a coronavirus vaccine more quickly than we think, gold could have some issues. This means that gold could face more volatility moving forward.",

Well, there are 3 important reasons for this that I share with you. First reason is that central governments of many countries are increasing gold reserves in their foreign reserves and they are getting away from the dollar. Second reason is that gold prices are increasing every time recession comes. And the same thing is happening in 2025. And third and most important is that gold demand in China has increased very fast because investors are now getting away from real estate and share market and are parking their money in gold and gold ETF. Well, what do you have to say on this? You can also leave your opinion in the comments.",
