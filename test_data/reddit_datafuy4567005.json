Geopolitical flex—gas prices might climb. (CNN)  \nSteel & Aluminum: 25% on all imports (even USMCA) unless melted here. Supply chains brace for chaos. (CBP)  \nCanada Twist: 50% steel/aluminum tariff cut to 25% after Ontario dropped its power surcharge. Auto threats loom. (Bloomberg)  \nUSMCA/Auto: Tariffs paused ‘til April 2; autos get a one-month pass. Trump wants production stateside. (CNN)  \nMarch 4 Drop:  \n25% on Mexico/Canada goods (some exempt).  \n10% on Canadian energy.  \n20% on China/Hong Kong.  \nNo refunds; de minimis TBD. (White House) Backlash: Canada hits US$22B with 25%; Mexico’s next; China slaps 15% on US chicken/wheat, 10% on soy/pork. (CNBC) Your Take? Jobs boost or price hike?

It takes at least a few days to pull together a coalition and draft a complaint that will stand up to the invevitable motions to dismiss. I think that argument that the statute does not grant POTUS authority to impose tariffs is very, very good, as long as the courts apply the reasoning of West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v. Nebraska honestly. I am ready to be patient for a few more days.\n\nI think that industry groups could also file such a complaint, but I doubt that they will - they are too vulnerable to retaliation.\n\nBy the way, a complaint filed in Florida late this week by a single plaintiff (Simplified v. Trump) makes these arguments, but only on the basis of the previously announced tariffs on imports from China. The legal arguments are the same, but the factual arguments are weaker because the size of the economic impacts are much smaller. Also, it is in the 11th Circuit.",

Medical devices, car parts, farm equipment, thousands of other things that they had been playing ball on so they could stay on the good side of the US.  Well the US just threw that all away, so now China is not bound by anything, they can just copy anything they want, slap their label on it, and sell it at their price, and full quality.\n\n  \nIf Chinese companies do this, it would be a further wedge between the US and China, and a substantial problem down the road if a rapprochement was tried.\n\n  \nThe drug companies are most at risk on this one IMO.  China can just start making all the US patented treatments, at full quality and start selling them at 50% of the price that the US companies are charging other countries around the world.  For those thinking they can't steal the full formulas for the products, if they can steal the plans for fighter jets, they can get the recipes for drugs.\n\n  \nWhat happens to the pharma companies when the Chinese start to sell newly patented treatments at 50 cents on the dollar?  What happens to the BioTech companies when the Chinese make cheap identical copies of their products?\n\n  \nAll's fair in love and trade wars.",

In contrast, the outlook for clean energy incentives and international collaboration on critical minerals policies appears less favorable under a second Trump administration.\n* President Biden has driven significant growth in downstream sectors, such as battery manufacturing, but the mining and processing of critical minerals have not kept pace, continuing U.S. reliance on imports. Addressing this imbalance will likely require a shift in approach under a Trump administration.\n* Trump will likely boost U.S. mining and processing, but reversing decades of underdevelopment will be slow, leaving China’s dominance over critical mineral supply chains largely intact throughout the remainder of this decade.\n* Tariffs on Chinese imports of critical minerals will likely spur U.S. mining but increase costs for industries like defense and electric vehicles (EVs), with potential Chinese retaliatory restrictions of critical mineral exports disrupting critical supply chain\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ds6i041478e1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=a65715ed3c81a3ac716a03730ca8aba5fa020ec2\n\n# U.S. Critical Minerals Policy to Date: \n\n \n\n***Trump will inherit several acts, partnerships and memoranda of understanding introduced by the Biden Administration on U.S. critical minerals policy, including:***\n\n* [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf) (IIJA) (2021): Allocated $1.2 trillion to infrastructure, driving demand for critical minerals. Highlights included $7.5 billion for EV chargers, $73 billion for power grid modernization, and $65 billion for broadband expansion, increasing demand for minerals like copper.\n* [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ169/PLAW-117publ169.pdf) (IRA) (2022): Offered $7,500 EV tax credits linked to battery minerals sourced from the U.S. or allied countries, $500 million in incentives for critical mineral mining and processing, $40 billion in loan guarantees available for critical minerals projects, and support for solar, wind, and energy storage technologies reliant on materials such as lithium, nickel, and rare-earth elements (REE).\n* [Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1042/text) (2024): Prohibits uranium imports from Russia with a [waiver](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1042) for nuclear power plant (NPP) operators extending until 2028.\n* [ADVANCE Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6544/text) (2024): Supports the development of advanced nuclear reactors and domestic nuclear fuel supply chains. The Department of Energy also allocated [$2.7 billion](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-27-billion-president-bidens-investing-america-agenda-boost-domestic-nuclear#:~:text=This%20RFP%20is%20supported%20by,Secretary%20of%20Energy%20Jennifer%20M.) in March 2024 for domestic uranium enrichment projects.\n* [Minerals Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/) (MSP) (2022): Unites the U.S., the EU, and 21 other countries to promote sustainable critical mineral supply chains, with key projects in Angola, Australia, Canada, the U.S., and Tanzania.\n* Bilateral agreements included a 2023 Critical Minerals Agreement (CMA) with [Japan](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/US%20Japan%20Critical%20Minerals%20Agreement%202023%2003%2028.pdf) to collaborate on supply chains for cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese, and nickel; a 2022 [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023.01.13-E-4-Release-MOU-USA-DRC-ZAMBIA-Tripartite-Agreement-Tab-1-MOU-for-U.S.-Assistance-to-Support-DRC-Zambia-EV-Value-Chain-Cooperation-Instrument.pdf) (MOU) with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to develop an EV supply chain leveraging their copper and cobalt resources; and a 2024 MOU with [India](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/secretary-raimondo-and-minister-goyal-convene-6th-us-india-commercial) focused on strengthening critical minerals supply chains.\n\n***Despite these measures, U.S. mining and processing lag behind demand, with long*** [***permitting times***](https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0724/SPGlobal_NMA_DevelopmentTimesUSinPerspective_June_2024.pdf) ***and regulatory hurdles deepening reliance on imports.

However, achieving substantial reductions in U.S. dependence on China-dominated supply chains is unlikely within a single presidential term and will require sustained and coordinated efforts extending well into the next decade.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pbwb3n87478e1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=24fd70983c107f2170a6642b04300b75b2503677\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qia1uz28478e1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=076e1d31149bc835de55590059a8245d18941dfa\n\n# Forward Look:\n\n    Financial Support\n\n* KSG assesses that a Trump administration is likely to extend financial support, including tax incentives, grants, and loans, to boost U.S. critical mineral mining. Bipartisan efforts to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals, combined with traditional Republican support for extractive industries, will likely drive these initiatives.\n* U.S. mineral producers will likely require increased public financial support to enhance output, particularly given low prices for key energy transition metals like cobalt, lithium, and nickel. For instance, Talon Metals’ [Tamarack nickel project](https://talonmetals.com/) in Minnesota faces significant market uncertainties, while the scheduled closure of Lundin Mining’s [Eagle Mine](https://www.eaglemine.com/) in Michigan by 2029 threatens to leave the U.S. without domestic nickel production. REE mining operations, such as California’s Mountain Pass facility—the only active REE mine and processing plant in the U.S.—are also likely to need substantial government support to stay competitive. Uranium \n* KSG assesses that Trump, who has expressed pro-nuclear views during his campaign, is likely to back financial initiatives aimed at bolstering U.S. uranium mining and enrichment capabilities, including the ADVANCE Act. This aligns with the critical role nuclear energy could play in powering data centers, which are essential for maintaining U.S. leadership over China in artificial intelligence development—a priority Trump has also emphasized. Currently, the U.S. operates only one [uranium enrichment plant](https://www.urenco.com/global-operations/uusa), leaving it heavily reliant on imports of enriched uranium, including from Russia. Domestic uranium mining remains at a [fraction](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/usa-nuclear-fuel-cycle) of its post-WWII peak, highlighting the need for significant investment to reduce dependence on foreign sources and strengthen U.S. energy security.Permitting                                                               \n* Permitting reform is likely to be a top priority in a second Trump administration, with a shift toward centralized decision-making and reduced regulatory barriers. After decades of decline, U.S. mining is regaining prominence, driven by the energy transition, renewed demand, and bipartisan consensus on the needs to reduce U.S. supply chain dependence on China. Reviving centralized oversight and permitting would likely help revitalise the industry by centralizing permitting and decision-making in Washington, significantly reducing bureaucratic delays.\n* Both Trump and Elon Musk, who has been nominated to head a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have [stressed](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/26/2017-27899/a-federal-strategy-to-ensure-secure-and-reliable-supplies-of-critical-minerals) the need for bringing more mines online. KSG assesses that Musk will leverage his influence with the new White House to advocate for streamlined federal oversight. Additionally, faster permitting processes would enhance Tesla’s supply chain security, particularly for critical minerals like [lithium](https://www.piedmontlithium.com/piedmont-lithium-amends-agreement-with-tesla/) and [nickel](https://talonmetals.com/tesla-and-talon-metals-enter-into-supply-agreement-for-nickel/).\n* KSG assesses that Trump is likely to expedite mining permits on federal lands and overturn President Biden’s moratorium on mining in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Area, aligning himself with Republican [criticism](https://stauber.house.gov/media/in-the-news/two-sides-square-hearing-bill-ban-mining-near-boundary-waters) of banning mining in the area.IRA Clean Energy Tax Credits\n* KSG assesses that Trump is likely to repeal IRA tax credits for EVs and renewable energy, potentially dismantling the legislation. Musk will likely advocate for repealing EV tax credits, which currently benefit Ford and GM more than Tesla due to their legacy costs. Eliminating subsidies would enhance Tesla’s competitive edge as a pure-play EV maker, allowing it to capture market [share](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) domestically, even if overall EV demand growth slows. KSG assesses that investments in solar and onshore wind energy will persist, even with reduced subsidies, albeit at a slower pace, driven by the cost competitiveness of electricity generated from these renewable sources.\n* However, repealing the IRA will likely face resistance, including from Republican lawmakers, as GOP districts have disproportionately benefited from IRA-driven investments in EV, battery, and solar manufacturing. Losing these subsidies will likely reduce EV demand, weaken U.S. critical mineral supply chains, and hinder domestic mining growth, increasing reliance on China. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1weturtf478e1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=87af3e7adca463c6d0c55a5c705c0d28bbeca885\n\n* Tariffs\n* KSG assesses that imposing tariffs on critical mineral imports from China would likely incentivize domestic extraction by making U.S. mining operations more competitive and stabilizing prices of key critical minerals currently depressed by global oversupply. While this would benefit domestic mining, tariffs on processed minerals would likely harm U.S. industries reliant on these materials—such as EV manufacturing—by increasing production costs and reducing domestic consumption.Defense Procurement\n* KSG assesses that increased military spending under a Trump administration is likely to include greater procurement of critical minerals essential for defense. Expanding the National Defense Stockpile with reserves sourced from domestic projects would help insulate U.S. defense industries from potential Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals, a likely retaliatory measure in response to tariffs. Implementing a long-term stockpiling program with guaranteed, pre-negotiated prices for producers could further mitigate against price volatility and encourage greater investment in U.S. mining and processing operations. Likely beneficiaries of such a program include junior miners focused on REE extraction, such as American Rare Earth, MP Materials, and Ramaco Resources, which would gain greater price stability and market certainty to advance their projects.                International Collaboration\n* KSG assesses that Trump is likely to avoid broad international collaboration on critical minerals, favoring bilateral agreements over comprehensive initiatives or free trade agreements (FTA). Trump is unlikely to support the MSP, casting uncertainty over its future. Trump is also unlikely to prioritize the 2022 MOU with the DRC and Zambia, which aims to build a complete cobalt and copper value chain, which would likely require significant private-sector investment from battery and EV manufacturers in the U.S., EU, Japan, or South Korea—a move Trump is unlikely to emphasize.\n* Instead, Trump is likely to support investments by Gulf nations, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in African mining operations and infrastructure projects for mineral transport and export. These Gulf countries act as relatively neutral players in the U.S.-China competition for African critical minerals, offering financing, trade infrastructure, and potential future [refining](https://www.lithiumtitan.com/) capabilities. KSG assesses that Trump would likely endorse Gulf sovereign wealth funds acquiring African critical mineral assets to counter Chinese influence, building on initiatives such as the Biden administration’s 2024 effort to facilitate the sale of DRC copper assets to Swiss trader Mercuria.\n* Trump is likely to prioritize narrower bilateral agreements with key critical mineral suppliers, avoiding the broader commitments of FTAs. Argentine President Javier Milei has expressed interest in pursuing an FTA with the U.S., potentially paving the way for a more limited partnership aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on Chinese-processed lithium—an initiative likely supported by Musk, who has ties to Milei and an interest in diversifying Tesla’s lithium supply. Similarly, Indonesia, the world’s [largest](https://www.knightsbridgesg.com/post/assessing-indonesian-nickel-production-associated-geopolitical-rivalry-and-wider-effects-october) nickel producer, has shown interest in a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S. akin to [Japan’s](https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100096004.pdf) arrangement. Such a deal could enhance U.S. access to Indonesian nickel and cobalt, reducing Chinese dominance in these sectors. However, Indonesia’s insistence on local refining requirements may pose challenges during negotiations. sector. However, Indonesia’s insistence on [local refining](https://setkab.go.id/en/govt-committed-to-stop-raw-material-exports/) may complicate negotiations. \n\n# Most Likely Scenario in 12 Months (December 2025):\n\n* The Trump administration will have imposed tariffs on critical mineral imports from China.. Domestic critical mineral projects will be advancing at a faster pace, supported by price protection and increased investment driven by reduced competition from lower-cost imports. However, Chinese retaliation through critical mineral export restrictions will be beginning to impact the domestic production of renewable energy technologies—such as EVs, batteries, and wind turbines—as well as essential military equipment, highlighting the strategic importance of expanding U.S. supply chain resilience.\n* The Trump administration will have repealed EV tax credits, reducing U.S. EV sales and causing the U.S. to lag further behind China in the transition to EVs. This disproportionately hurts Ford and GM, which face higher costs transitioning to EV production, while Tesla capitalizes on its EV-only model to gain market share from legacy automakers.\n* The Trump administration will be accelerating permitting processes on federal lands, unlocking new opportunities for mineral extraction.. Trump will have reversed Biden’s ban on copper mining in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Area, winning Republican support but igniting significant backlash from environmental activists. Despite the controversy, Trump will press forward with mining initiatives, resisting pressure from advocacy groups. Trump will also have side-lined environmental litigation challenging Biden’s permit for the Rhyolite Ridge lithium deposit in Nevada, paving the way for mining operations to proceed.\n* Under Musk’s leadership, the DOGE will be streamlining and centralizing mining regulations, reducing the influence of state and local authorities and creating a more favorable regulatory environment.\n* With financial support, reduced regulatory burdens, and protection through tariffs, the U.S. mining sector will be attracting greater private sector investment. Investors will be betting on long-term growth in critical mineral demand and an eventual price recovery, boosting the sector’s trajectory.\n* KSG anticipates that China, which dominates the refining of critical minerals, would likely retaliate against U.S. tariffs by imposing export restrictions on these materials—a tactic it has previously [employed](https://english.mofcom.gov.cn/News/PressConference/art/2023/art_36fb2d80e4b4453891bb8fc83e2b3c4e.html). Given the U.S.'s heavy reliance on China for critical minerals—especially REE essential for defense technologies—such measures could significantly disrupt the manufacturing of key equipment including permanent magnets (used in wind turbines, EVs, and military applications such as weapon systems and precision guided munitions). KSG assesses that such retaliatory moves would likely increase incentives for the incoming Trump administration to prioritize and expedite the development of domestic critical mineral mining and processing operations, ultimately eroding China’s market share, supply dominance, and pricing power.\n\n# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSONS ABOVE:\n\n\\*\\*\\*OVERALL BODES WELL FOR NIOCORP (PENDING FINANCE) IMHO ....\n\n# Niocorp's Elk Creek Project is \"Standing Tall\"....see for yourself...\n\n# [NioCorp Developments Ltd. – Critical Minerals Security](https://www.niocorp.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9dcz82fx478e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ede97f96480d6b36f6e8215903cd5672f6e0f9f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhfuedr4578e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d802ee952c98378a42825e5a953bcf30ba5b01\n\n# SEE REDDTI POST: THE ELK CREEK DEPOSIT 2024 REVIEW PART #1~ (For new investors & old... )Following the trail to build a new U.S. Mine in Nebraska....\n\n[\\#NIOCORP\\~ THE ELK CREEK DEPOSIT 2024 REVIEW PART #1\\~ (For new investors & old... )Following the trail to build a new U.S. Mine in Nebraska.... : r/NIOCORP\\_MINE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1giphlj/niocorp_the_elk_creek_deposit_2024_review_part_1/)\n\n# JUST HOW BIG IS THE DEPOSIT? See Responses to Direct Questions posed to Jim Sims!)\n\n# ON 5/27/2022 Jim: How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other \"World Class Projects?\"\n\n**REPSONSE:**\n\n*\"* ***It is a bit tricky to compare rare earth projects on an apples-to-apples basis, which is why we chose to limit the comparison of our Elk Creek resource to other REE projects in the U.S. There are several reasons why.For one, there are several different legal systems that determine how a project can measure and disclose aspects of its mineral resource and/or reserve. For public companies that are SEC-reporting entities (such as NioCorp), the SK1300 standard must be followed. For public companies regulated by Canadian authorities (also such as NioCorp), there is the National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standard. In Australia, there is the JORC standard. Each of these systems differ in what they allow, or don't allow, in terms of public disclosure of mineral resources and reserves. This can lead to 'apples-to-oranges' comparisons among projects.Another challenge in making such comparisons is the mineralization of an REE project. Some projects can show a high ore grade of rare earths, but the mineralization of the ore is something that is very difficult to process. For example, rare earth projects based on silicate-based minerals -- such as eudialyte -- are extraordinarily difficult to economically process in order to pull the REEs out and separate them. Others can contain relatively high levels of other impurities, such as naturally occurring radioactive elements, that can increase the cost of processing. A high ore grade doesn't mean a lot if the REE mineralization isn't amenable to processing that is technically or economically infeasible. This is why only a small handful of the more than 200 REE-containing minerals have ever been successfully processed economically at commercial scale. (The two primary REE-containing minerals in the Elk Creek Project, bastnasite and monazite, are among those that have been successfully processed for decades).Rare earth resources also differ in terms of the relative distribution of individual REEs in the host mineral. Some may have a relatively high ore grade but also have high percentages of less valuable REEs, such as cerium or lanthanum or yttrium. Others have lower ore grades but their REE mineralization is skewed more favorably to higher-value REEs, such as the magnetics neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium which are used in NdFeB magnets. There are several other REEs that are also magnetic, such as samarium, but those are of lower value. Another way that REE projects are compared to one another is through a so-called “basket price.” This is a particularly misleading way of valuing a rare earth play, in my opinion, because a project’s ‘basket price’ assigns a dollar value to the individual REEs in the ore, multiplying total tonnes of each REE by current market price for that REE, and combines them all together. This assumes that a project will produce each and every one of the REEs in the ‘basket’ (which is almost never the case). It also ignores the enormous CAPEX and OPEX required to produce 14 or so individual REEs. There are yet other factors that help determine the viability of a potential rare earth project***\n\n***.\\~Some projects*** ***are aimed at only producing rare earths. That means that they are relatively riskier investments than projects that are designed to produce multiple products in addition to rare earths.***\n\n***\\~Some projects that are relatively large in size, have high ore grades, and are comprised of processable minerals -- but they are located in places that make mining and processing difficult or very expensive. I can think of a few projects that are touted as attractive deposits but are located near or above the Arctic Circle, which generally makes mining more costly.***\n\n***\\~ Others are located in places where there local residents, such as First Nations communities in Canada or anywhere in Greenland, can readily block a project from moving to commercial operation. Still others are in countries where local governments are less stable than in the U.S., or are simply prone to corruption, which exposes the project to high country risk.***\n\n***\\~Many REE projects are proposed by teams that have no experience in commercially processing REEs. They tend to gloss over that fact. Knowing what I know about the challenges of producing separated, high-purity REEs, this is one of the most important factors I consider when I look at REE projects. But that is just my opinion. A more useful comparison strategy for investors is to look at rare earth projects through multiple lenses, such as those I describe above. It is not easy to do this if one doesn’t have a pretty deep understanding of the REE industry and the challenges of successfully making these strategic metals. Having said all of that, it’s clear that our Elk Creek carbonatite is very large and similar in total contained rare earths to some of the largest known rare earth resources in the world, including the Araxa carbonatite in Brazil and the St. Honore carbonatite in Quebec.***\n\n***Jim Sims\"***\n\n*(WoW! somewhere between Araxa & St. Honore!.......Take a peek for yourself!)*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6lgdpqc678e1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5927515498b6c21ee45c98cfee04e57f9012a15\n\n# AS OF JUNE, 2023 NIOCORP RANKS AMONG TOP 30 REE PROJECTS ~ Global rare earth elements projects: New developments and supply chains:\n\n[Global rare earth elements projects: New developments and supply chains (sciencedirectassets.com)](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271770/1-s2.0-S0169136823X00055/1-s2.0-S0169136823001439/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIB4fcjFFPDmMBpR4WIIsHt3cNUcLdvWSSUcfJnP0E7f1AiEA6HkcjlGHFBWLi0GxLY%2Fpr8bNiR48mq3SHR1InSjbEnUqsgUIdBAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDN8%2FBQAtl4cjNfpD7CqPBQe2%2BrZvn6x5JTBR51R0OmnQLZwSEk9hUGeFOXLVoRnrAnjXcVsHdM7kH6Jaam5cvWgNBtiexSfEy%2Bpi5tWCyMTZ4qDqhDCLxOI2%2FTTmioYJoKYua%2FpIgLDOyVE8lZxQuw6d3PoXAumqNEhz4SF2f9ni2gUahMAB9p3fnwNjHfTVdoBWt81I4e4COV6D5Ib8HREl9mePgPw%2Ff80hEK9lcC04swWYt1sqnI2R2Xr6d%2B7RbqE2njFKqUOijEdDNZjKZRSHpm5cSHYR1Cwp%2FMoiDvzZAkCz8D5cnvmRG5urzHZ32a%2FyUnGXPVj8pYjvTlxb5A%2F1x86Lxf6iJyoM7uJ3B2LVXw6JI0UvpU7466jrQz18CIeL3N%2FGz4Vkr%2BWrIFLf2azH2GVMiIRmsch5Lq5a1YuLIBZBcihlHuFGwzIRB8S7A7Q5r%2FNRIw4FSNSfr5CDxajXf%2BWaJqJc6vQ1E79PEvm%2BVv7HdjysLuF%2FxsEe%2B75KeWE4IlaXnSoTHgmicMyTDQqxH4XsAIU5rk62qheDbH9EHNUaRk92MjCN%2B40AOlcfWg6RaKm06bdCDhJL8bCOkzjmQfi%2BJzO0OlZkg44n1dK7Q6fjKWy4l4rQp2713jxkmrqb8zejyFcYdwwxr4tXTjWLRepLqvCPj4jYXtZvoPs9U9qR5ynuwmm6B3lZXVvOF7vHoXs9oZzHx7Ib80yBCXQg%2BjP13SkB%2F%2BPCT8KW2rwV2WAGDTa0T2P4dFDO7xHDFUarflXaCON1njlS84CvMS0M69lU72%2FtEuemWZKucUnpGAlKyREXOUYHFX5XBjxjWcOiPNojM5Q9Co%2BNcEvUHkAPbF%2FGJuyyrDsEnFVCNxmuh%2FrxVYN97tuG2r8PelIw6avhpwY6sQGpzDXav6k8S6KfUjd394YDPriWbqDRUdHRJZiaz6RQrKW%2F1zl2z7RQQruTTzYbwp6uTuUdSNKNYW6a4Vq3otpHJiQ%2FqwvO4g4%2Bk5%2FTAtiC3SQVmXkMv%2FXCQ8VuVv6zjXtMNoqFLNXcb%2B1BWT9I1ot6on7qAm%2BAflvKILQWUw1OQiLWHio46LVdumxg4ZctyKU5qQzZMqvNEoIWHn5tfOn8hbpMhQdYcZysvRAyNbCIHx8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20230906T110951Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY2WZDJ5M2%2F20230906%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=6f7a43dcf988f426d5f0d3edabb6ecffdf2abb34fb6351e5b44e7cf27a7c0879&hash=54e5a1b6b2c5ed05723146863b8fbfe78b4ee024887fde4149121bbfe860e91f&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S0169136823001439&tid=spdf-acef2928-61c1-40ac-bb62-43bd8a0bf4ad&sid=e71c1ebc2169684a585941f355a67f5e90ccgxrqa&type=client&tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&ua=111d57515c5450575f&rr=802643197c7a4cc0&cc=us)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jah50wf678e1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b8e1a6cbaeb618d451e3995b2625d454b88aded\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loslklx0778e1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5bd65300ef2cf43daada5169fe694bffac712ae\n\n# ~KNOWING WHAT NIOBIUM, TITANIUM, SCANDIUM & RARE EARTH MINERALS CAN DO FOR BATTERIES, MAGNETS, LIGHT-WEIGHTING, AEROSPACE, MILITARY, OEMS, ELECTRONICS & SO MUCH MORE....~\n\n# ~KNOWING THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A U.S. DOMESTIC, SECURE, TRACEABLE, ESG DRIVEN, CARBON FRIENDLY, GENERATIONAL CRITICAL MINERALS MINING; & A CIRCULAR-ECONOMY & MARKETPLACE FOR ALL~\n\n# ~SPECULATING BOTH U.S. GOVT., DoD -\"STOCKPILE\", & PRIVATE INDUSTRIES ARE STILL INTERESTED!!!...\n\n[YEP....
