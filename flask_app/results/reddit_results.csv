So top companies like Google, Microsoft, Tesla, IBM look for these top talents on the campuses all over India. 

The starting salaries they are offered compared to what local firms will offer are miles apart. So I see when people are complaining about HB1 Visa holders working 80 hours per week or getting a starting salary of 80k or something.

Companies are in business to make money and if they can find great candidates for slightly cheaper and who can work their ass off what do you think they will do.

Recently Trump has said he is for LEGAL immigration with the Hb1 visa discussion, and people have pointed out he's always been for legal immigration, but I have also seen him generalize immigrants like Haitians for example and those from Mexico; so which is it? 

It also seemed like at the time of the election his followers were against immigration regardless of legal standing and seeing the racist comments right now about Indians, having always seen them about other minorities from MAGA; now I'm seeing MAGA say immigration is good for the country when that's what the left has said the entire time. 

I'm confused on where MAGA stands on with this.
